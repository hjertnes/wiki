I'm not sure what I am doing here. Anyways. I thought the [one](https://rudimentarylathe.org/) [@jack](https://micro.blog/jack) have was very cool. The basic idea is that I'll just fill up this wiki with interesting stuff. Everything that isn't a blog post will probably end up here.

As I have been adding more stuff and extending this place I think this might replace my blog for a lot of stuff. Instead of writing blog posts this will probably turned into a nested structure of notes I do some extent keep updated.

It is made with org-mode, ox-hugo, hugo and hosted on Linode behind Caddy.

It is generated from [this](https://git.sr.ht/~hjertnes/wiki/tree/master/static/wiki.org) org-file.
