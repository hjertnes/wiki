I'm Eivind, this is my wiki. Here is by [blog](https://hjertnes.blog) and this is my only social media thing [@hjertnes](https://dog.estate/@hjertnes).

I live at Stanghelle, right outside Bergen, Norway with my dogs, daughter and fianc√®.

I currently work as a web developer, mostly using JavaScript, React and C#; in the past I have done a lot of PHP and Python. These days I mostly do Golang for fun. I have also done other kinds of work in  past, mainly fundraising, bartending and IT work.
