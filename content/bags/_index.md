## What's in my small bag {#what-s-in-my-small-bag}

What I typically bring when I hike is:

-   My X-Pro 2 w/ the 23mm lens
-   Extra batteries
-   My Phone
-   Extra memory cards
-   My water bottle.
-   Bellroy Field Notes Case, plus a pencil and my Ystudio fountain pen

Or when we go somewhere:

-   My X-Pro 2 w/ the 23mm lens
-   The 50mm lens
-   Extra batteries
-   Extra memory cards
-   Phone, wallet, keys, cleaning cloth for my glasses
-   My kindle.
-   A small powerbank.
-   Bellroy Field Notes Case, plus a pencil and my Ystudio fountain pen

The thing I love about this bag is that you can bring a bunch of stuff
with you, but not a lot.


## In my pockets / on my person {#in-my-pockets-on-my-person}

    something Elvis Costello would have worn.

## Bag reviews for bags I use {#bag-reviews-for-bags-i-use}


### Tom Bihn Pilot {#tom-bihn-pilot}

It used to be my main bag for a long time. From I got my 2016 MacBook Escape until early 2019.

It is a great bag, that worked really well for the kind of stuff I wanted to carry. I can stuff more into that bag because of the great design than I can get into much larger bags. It is just very dense.

The Synik 22 are much larger, but I can almost fix the same amount of stuff into the Pilot.


### Tom Bihn Synik 22 {#tom-bihn-synik-22}

This is my current bag. But it is in for repairs at the moment.

But it has room for more stuff than the Pilot. I can stuff way more stuff than I should drag back and forth to work into it.

It is a clamshell  bag so it is really easy to deal with.


### Fjellreven Foldstack no 3 {#fjellreven-foldstack-no-3}

I got this bag because I sometimes want to bring some stuff, but not that much. Like my Kindle, a notebook and a camera. Or something similar. It is awesome for that, because it is not that big that you end up bringing a lot of crap.


### Photobag Lowpro Nova 170AW 2 {#photobag-lowpro-nova-170aw-2}

It is a small bag, I can fit my X-Pro 2, three lenses plus some batteries and SD cards.

This is the bag I bring when I just bring my camera and a few extra things. It is awesome for that.


### Big camera backpack: Lowpro BP 250AW 2 {#big-camera-backpack-lowpro-bp-250aw-2}

This is a big backpack with room for some photo gear on the back of the bag, making it really hard to steam if off your back.

I like it a lot. But I alost never need it. Usually when I travel I'll not bring all of the other stuff with me so I bring the Nova and some other bag instead.

But when I need to bring a bunch of stuff and camera gear on a trip it is great.


## Bag reviews for bags that did not work out {#bag-reviews-for-bags-that-did-not-work-out}


### Snout bag (did not work out) {#snout-bag--did-not-work-out}

I got a snout bag when I got my first DSLR. It was kind of like a big lens cap. It works okay with small and medium size lenses. But beyond a certain size it simply put won't fit.

I used it for a while, but I never liked it and it never felt useful.


### My second photo bag (did not work out) {#my-second-photo-bag--did-not-work-out}

The next bag I got was  from Lowpro. Yo have probably seen it, it kind of looks like a tall box. I hated it. I think it was similar to the HP 150

Because it was too big for most cases, but too small to fit a lot of stuff. And it was too tall, so most of the time only the bottom half of the bag was in use.


### Fjellreven Foldstack no 2 {#fjellreven-foldstack-no-2}

I got a large Fjellreven Foldstack messenger bag a while back. I did not work out.

I replaced it with a Tom Bihn Synik within a year.

It was okay bag, but it didn't work out for me becase the whole layout of the bag isn't that great for the kind of stuff I carry.

Seriously. My Tom Bihn Pilot, who can fit inside the Foldstack with some room to spare can fit more of the stuff I want to carry on day to day than te Foldstack.

This is all because of much better layout, a lot of smaller but not too small compartments instead of a few large.
