## Tom Bihn Pilot {#tom-bihn-pilot}

It used to be my main bag for a long time. From I got my 2016 MacBook Escape until early 2019.

It is a great bag, that worked really well for the kind of stuff I wanted to carry. I can stuff more into that bag because of the great design than I can get into much larger bags. It is just very dense.

The Synik 22 are much larger, but I can almost fix the same amount of stuff into the Pilot.


## Tom Bihn Synik 22 {#tom-bihn-synik-22}

This is my current bag. But it is in for repairs at the moment.

But it has room for more stuff than the Pilot. I can stuff way more stuff than I should drag back and forth to work into it.

It is a clamshell  bag so it is really easy to deal with.


## Fjellreven Foldstack no 3 {#fjellreven-foldstack-no-3}

I got this bag because I sometimes want to bring some stuff, but not that much. Like my Kindle, a notebook and a camera. Or something similar. It is awesome for that, because it is not that big that you end up bringing a lot of crap.


## Photobag Lowpro Nova 170AW 2 {#photobag-lowpro-nova-170aw-2}

It is a small bag, I can fit my X-Pro 2, three lenses plus some batteries and SD cards.

This is the bag I bring when I just bring my camera and a few extra things. It is awesome for that.


## Big camera backpack: Lowpro BP 250AW 2 {#big-camera-backpack-lowpro-bp-250aw-2}

This is a big backpack with room for some photo gear on the back of the bag, making it really hard to steam if off your back.

I like it a lot. But I alost never need it. Usually when I travel I'll not bring all of the other stuff with me so I bring the Nova and some other bag instead.

But when I need to bring a bunch of stuff and camera gear on a trip it is great.
