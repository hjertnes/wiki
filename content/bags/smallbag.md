What I typically bring when I hike is:

-   My X-Pro 2 w/ the 23mm lens
-   Extra batteries
-   My Phone
-   Extra memory cards
-   My water bottle.
-   Bellroy Field Notes Case, plus a pencil and my Ystudio fountain pen

Or when we go somewhere:

-   My X-Pro 2 w/ the 23mm lens
-   The 50mm lens
-   Extra batteries
-   Extra memory cards
-   Phone, wallet, keys, cleaning cloth for my glasses
-   My kindle.
-   A small powerbank.
-   Bellroy Field Notes Case, plus a pencil and my Ystudio fountain pen

The thing I love about this bag is that you can bring a bunch of stuff
with you, but not a lot.
