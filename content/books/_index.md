## Ayn Rand {#ayn-rand}

I have read her books once, and now I'm re-reading them.

I enjoy the story as fiction. As a philosophy major I can say that there is no good philosophy in there.

But I enjoy it, without seeing anything "great" in there.


## Malcom Gladwell {#malcom-gladwell}

I recently got a Malcom Gladwell Audio Book called "Talking to strangers". And I really loved it.

I know he isn't that great, or original. But I really enjoy just getting one of his books and wasting a few hours.

And I always end up with some interesting idea or five out of his books.

Some people get too hung up in the deatils. Like the 10 000 hours thing. What I took from it was that "most stuff requires a lot of hard work".


## Rober Carro's working {#rober-carro-s-working}

Robert Carro is probably my favourite biopgrahers. But his work is more about power than being about the person.

The big problem with all of his books until recently was that they would be a huge undertaking, and most people would never get into it. It for instance took me years to start listening to his books on Robert Moses even though it was downloaded on my phone.

So, he recently published a Audible book thing called On Power, that I think is a really good place to start, and now he has published a book about how he works called Working, that is a really good next step.

Before you start on the huge books on Robert Moses and LBJ.
