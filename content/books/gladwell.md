I recently got a Malcom Gladwell Audio Book called "Talking to strangers". And I really loved it.

I know he isn't that great, or original. But I really enjoy just getting one of his books and wasting a few hours.

And I always end up with some interesting idea or five out of his books.

Some people get too hung up in the deatils. Like the 10 000 hours thing. What I took from it was that "most stuff requires a lot of hard work".
