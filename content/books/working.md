Robert Carro is probably my favourite biopgrahers. But his work is more about power than being about the person.

The big problem with all of his books until recently was that they would be a huge undertaking, and most people would never get into it. It for instance took me years to start listening to his books on Robert Moses even though it was downloaded on my phone.

So, he recently published a Audible book thing called On Power, that I think is a really good place to start, and now he has published a book about how he works called Working, that is a really good next step.

Before you start on the huge books on Robert Moses and LBJ.
