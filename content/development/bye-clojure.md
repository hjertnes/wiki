Over the last 2-3 years I have tried really hard to make Clojure work for me. I love the languages and the ideas. But it does not work for me.

There is always something that makes it really hard. The tooling is good, but not all the way there. It always requires a lot of work to get it to function.

And the ClojureScript setup is a nightmare.

I might come back, but this is it for me for now.
