Just some notes for myself after spending a great deal of time testing out various things over a few days to see if I can find something in the same ball park as Create React App with Redux.

-   Figwheel Main is awesome. But the default settings are weird
-   Rum and Reagent are interesting. But I have a hard time finding anything else than re-frame that seems like a complete solution
-   Reframe is a lot of stuff"" to understand, but it just works, and like you expect. But I'm not a fan of it because it feels very much like a framework.

TODO:
This is what I should do in order to make ClojureScript work for me

-   Build something that kind of work like React+Redux based on Clojure atoms
-   Build some wrapper arround the router thing to make it less verbose.
-   And it hsould all be based on Reagent, Figwheel-main etc.
-   And this <https://github.com/Lokeh/reagent-context>
-   And this <https://github.com/ghedamat/reagent-react-router>
