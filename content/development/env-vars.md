A enviornment variable is a variable managed my the OS. It is my favourite way to configure stuff like docker containers etc. The reason it is awesome is that it is way easier to manage than files for stuff that vary in environments. Config files are fine for stuff that are always the fine, but I kind of think it is better to just hardcode it unless you'll actually change it. ]

And the best thing about them is that they work on all languages etc.
