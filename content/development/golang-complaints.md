I have written a bunch of go code at this point. And there is obviously some stuff I'm not happy with.

First of all, I miss methods like .map, .filter, .reduce and the rest from JavaScript (or similar in C#).

The other thing I miss is better code coverage reports. The HTML is fine, but I miss better stuff.

Golang is awesome though.  These things are really minor.
