Some notes on the tools I use to do golang dev.


## Goland {#goland}

With the 2020.1 release, Goland feels like the better option for Go development. It feels more or less the same level of quality as IntelliJ or Rider.


## Emacs {#emacs}

It works great most of the time, sometimes the autocomplete dies, but that is almost alwasys solved by restarting LSP. And sometimes the source is too screwed up for it to make sense of it.


## VS Code {#vs-code}

Is mostly the same as Emacs. Makes sense since they use the same stuff behind the scenes.
