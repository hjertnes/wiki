After I decided to drop Clojure I made a short list of languages to evaluate.

Ruby was the first thing I looked at. But it isn't what I want.

Then I took a look at Golang. And I have decided to continue down this road.

This is what I like about it

-   Good enough tooling
-   A  general attitude in the community towards weirdness and getting shit done.
-   The language is like C but modern and async.

I also love how small and simple the language is.
