Some C# and .NET resources that I think are great.

-   [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/). I recommend starting here, there are a lot of great guides and information there
-   [Pro C#](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-NET-Core-Andrew-Troelsen/dp/1484230175). A great book for learning more C#. It is a little bit dated, because of the focus on .NET Framework but all the stuff about the C# language is still relevant
-   [This Microsoft book](https://www.amazon.com/Adaptive-Code-principles-Developer-Practices-ebook/dp/B071YC5ML9) about Design Patterns are great, and I recommend all C# developers to read it, and re-reading at least once a year. I learn something new every time I read it.
