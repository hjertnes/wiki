24 Bottle came out with a sportslid not too long ago. And I finally got around to ordering one.

It is plastic, but the quality is great and it works fantastic. With two minor comments there someimes are some condensation on it after a while and sometimes you need to bump it to get the water flowing out. Probably because of vaccum or something.

The regular lid is way better, but the sports lid is way more useful.

And I kind of broke mine after a couple of months by dropping it in the street outside my house.
