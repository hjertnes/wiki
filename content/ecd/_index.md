## 24h Bottle Caps {#24h-bottle-caps}

I'm a huge fan of 24H, we have two their bottles. And I'm probably buy one of their coffee cups soon.

They are awesome, my bottle have been dropped in the street outside my house three times, each of them would have broken the previous bottles I have used.

There are two caps available for the 24H. A regular all metal twist cap. It is awesome. No leaking, ever. No condensation. Built like a tank and it does not look like anything could break it.

And then they have a sports lid. It is made out of plastic. Instead of having to untwist it, you can flip up a straw and drink from it.

I have used both. One of the time I dropped my bottle, it was with the sportslid and it split in two. But up until that it was great.

It is way moe convenient, but it isn't as good as the regular one. There is some condensation on it, and it broke.


## 24H Bottle sports lid. {#24h-bottle-sports-lid-dot}

24 Bottle came out with a sportslid not too long ago. And I finally got around to ordering one.

It is plastic, but the quality is great and it works fantastic. With two minor comments there someimes are some condensation on it after a while and sometimes you need to bump it to get the water flowing out. Probably because of vaccum or something.

The regular lid is way better, but the sports lid is way more useful.

And I kind of broke mine after a couple of months by dropping it in the street outside my house.


## Coffee mug {#coffee-mug}

My current coffee mug is Hario Soto Magu mug.

-   The coffee remains hot for a really long time- Easy to clean
-   I can't see any part of it will break or wear down fast.


## Trove Wallet {#trove-wallet}

I ordered a Trove Wallet in 2016. I think I got it right before easter. And I just love it. It is a really simple wallet or card holder with three compartments. A large in the middle and two smaller on each side.

What makes it great however is that it is made out of an elastic material. This means that if you downscale the cards don't just fall out.

The one I have is still awesome, and I have no plans of getting rid of it. But it is showing some signs of wear.

They have made a newer model since I got mine, and I'll maybe look into that when I the one I have fall apart. ime it made sense to have seperate web sites. But at this point it is just a bunch of extra work for me. And I have just continued writing a bunch of stuff for like a year even though I would have made more sense to combine the sites.

This means that I am going to write less about stationary stuff. But I'm still going to write some about it. And my overall goal is to continue writing 3 posts a week as I did when I had two different sites.


## Water Bottle {#water-bottle}

I have owne a number of plastic water bottles over the years, including multiple from contigo.

And while I was happy with them, they were in no way perfect. So in the end of 2018 I decided to order a tripple walled bottle from 24 Bottles.

I got the "climate" bottle, it has two layers of insulation keep cold water cold for 24 hours and hot stuff hot for 12.

I went with a black one with the largest capacity available. My only regret is that I did not get one without paint on it. Becase it isn't the kind of finish that look cool as it's worn down.

I love this bottle, I can fill it with ice after dinner and still have some left when I get home from work.

This is the kind of bottle I don't see myself having to replace in a very long time. You could probably drive a car over it and still use it after.

The default lid is very old school and sturdy, but you have to screw and unscrew it. It is what I have used since I got mine close to a year ago. But I have ordered one of the new sport lids that is more like regular water bottles where you don't have to unscrew it.

I strongly recommend getting one from 24 Bottles.

What I like about it is that unlike the plastic bottles the water never gets hot. This was a huge issue when I used a plastic bottle in the office.
