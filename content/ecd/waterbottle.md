I have owne a number of plastic water bottles over the years, including multiple from contigo.

And while I was happy with them, they were in no way perfect. So in the end of 2018 I decided to order a tripple walled bottle from 24 Bottles.

I got the "climate" bottle, it has two layers of insulation keep cold water cold for 24 hours and hot stuff hot for 12.

I went with a black one with the largest capacity available. My only regret is that I did not get one without paint on it. Becase it isn't the kind of finish that look cool as it's worn down.

I love this bottle, I can fill it with ice after dinner and still have some left when I get home from work.

This is the kind of bottle I don't see myself having to replace in a very long time. You could probably drive a car over it and still use it after.

The default lid is very old school and sturdy, but you have to screw and unscrew it. It is what I have used since I got mine close to a year ago. But I have ordered one of the new sport lids that is more like regular water bottles where you don't have to unscrew it.

I strongly recommend getting one from 24 Bottles.

What I like about it is that unlike the plastic bottles the water never gets hot. This was a huge issue when I used a plastic bottle in the office.
