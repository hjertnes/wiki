This is mostly for me, but this is a growing list of keyboard shortcusts for Emacs. Some because I never recommend them others because others might find them useful.

M=meta/alt, C=control, S=super/windows/cmd, SPC=space.

-   C-x C-s: save
-   C-x s: save as
-   C-x C-f: open file
-   C-x h: mark entire buffer
-   C-x C-b: list buffers
-   C-x b: select buffer
-   Note: I have both(C-x b and C-x C-b) bound to ivy-switch-buffer on my system.
-   C-g: cancel what ever you're doing
-   M-x: run interactive command
-   M-m: first non whitespace character on a line
-   C-x [: page up
-   C-x ]: page down
