Emacs configurations can be really strange, and unlike a lot of other config files they can contain hundreds if not thousands of lines of comments and code.

Org have something called org-babel that let you extract code from org documents. This enable you to write your config as a org document.

The reason you might want to do this is because it enables you to focus more on commenting and writing how and why for everything in your configuration.

I did it a while back (and have a starter repo for you here) and I think my config is a hell of a lot better for it.
