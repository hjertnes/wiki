Ace jump mode is this weird mode everyone should learn. Mine is set up to trigger on C-c SPC. So the basic idea is that you hit the keyboard command and a character. Then each place that character is you see a character starting from a. Then you hit the character representing where you want to go and wolla. You're there.

It is very simple, and awesome. Also: it seems like most people have it installed.
