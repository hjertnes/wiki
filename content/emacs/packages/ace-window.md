Ace-window is a emacs package that makes it easy to jump between "windows" in Emacs, just like ace-jump is a emacs package that makes it easy to jump in a document.

These are all the default commands and keybindings, the way it works is that you press M-o, then a number will be shown in each "window", if you press it focus will be moved to it. And if you for example press x before the number it will instead delete that window.

-   x - delete window
-   m - swap windows
-   M - move window
-   c - copy window
-   j - select buffer
-   n - select the previous window
-   u - select buffer in the other window
-   c - split window fairly, either vertically or horizontally
-   v - split window vertically
-   b - split window horizontally
-   o - maximize current window
-   ? - show these command bindings
