I'm not using this at the moment, but I have used it a lot in the past. Deft is a emacs package that adds functionality that is more or less like nvAlt. For those who don't know what that is:

-   An app that use a folder of text files as their database
-   One note per file
-   You have a search field, list of notes and a content area
-   As you type into the search area the list of notes are filtered
-   When you hit enter you either open the selected note or create a new one with the current search as filename if none matches exist.

Most of my notes these days are larger org files instead of a lot of tiny text files. But if this is your thing I recommend checking it out. But you should also look at the [website](https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/) because there are a lot of information about how to configure it there.
