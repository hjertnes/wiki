Emacs has a bunch of shit in it that is freaking awesome, and how awesome it is only comes to light as you start see how they work together. Dired is a file manager in emacs. You can start it with C-x d. I use it all the time to do stuff I previously used to do with terminal. Like moving and deleting files.
