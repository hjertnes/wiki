Neotree a emacs package I'm not a huge fan of. It is fine, but I never liked it a lot. It is basically a port of a vim plugin called Nerdtree. If you're looking for a simple show a directly structure file explorer I guess it is fine. But I would recommend looking into [treemacs](/emacs/treemacs)instead, because it is a LOT better.
