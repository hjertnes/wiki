So, I love this package: no-easy-keys. It is the package that really got me into learning the emacs way of life. The short version is that there are keybindings in emacs that make it work as much as you expect it would from other programs like arrow keys etc. And then you have the emacs way of life. Like like C-b for moving backwards or C-f for forward.

It sounds weird, but it is a lot better once you get used to it.

So there is this package called no-easy-keys that just disable them. It was really useful for me to get all the emacs stuff into my fingers when I started out learning emacs keybindings.

I strongly recommend it if you're starting out learning.
