I use two different emacs packages called rainbow-identifiers and rainbow-delimiters to colorize two different things in Emacs to make code more readable.

-   identifiers gives different identifiers like variables, functions or operators different colors so you can easier to distinguish between them and see where something is used.
-   delimiters on the other hands makes sure that deliminers like (), [], {} have different colors. This can be very useful in a number of sitations, especially in lips where you often see a lot of them. And it makes it possible with a glance to identify where an expression starts and ends.
