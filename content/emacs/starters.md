-   I have made one based on my own setup <https://git.sr.ht/~hjertnes/emacs-starter>
-   <http://spacemacs.org/>
-   <https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs>
-   <https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d>
-   <https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude>

I use once of them (the first), I have previously used spacemacs and doom for a significant amount of time. I recommend picking one of the last four if you're just starting out, use doom or spacemacs if you want vim like keybindings or prelude or purcell's emacs.d if you want default ones. Other than that the four are similar. I think my personal setup is a great place to start if you want to build something from scratch.
