Okay. So most of my shit is oriented through different git repositories. And the most important part of that workflow is projectile M-p p to switch project or M-p SPC to search for a file.

Because of this, it is much more natural for me to use projectile than something like deft. And I prefer having a few larger org documents instead of the a million different files concept that deft, roam and more use. It was popularized by notational velocity.
