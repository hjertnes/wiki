I have been thinking a lot about how to share links over the last couple
of months. My old style was to add a post for each link. The reason I
used to do that was because it started as a Micropub like, and I just
kept doing it after I moved away from using Micropub. I have decided
that I as a reader would prefer that someone collected them and posted
it in one larger post instead of many smaller ones.

The way I consume content online these days is that anything that looks
even a little bit interesting are sent to Instapaper, and the stuff I
think was interesting or cool are marked as a favourite there. So what I
am going to do is that once a week I'll empty out my likes from
Instapaper and share them here.
