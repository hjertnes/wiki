    Koans is a language learning exercise in the same vein as the ruby
    koans, python koans and others. It is a port of the prior koans with
    some modifications to highlight lisp-specific features. Structured as
    ordered groups of broken unit tests, the project guides the learner
    progressively through many Common Lisp language features.](https://github.com/google/lisp-koans)
