A while since last time, I wanted to automate this process a little bit.
Then I didn't hear back from Instapaper about a API token and I went for
a less ideal solution. It is a lot better though. Long story short, I
wrote a node script that parses a exported csv files. I'll probably get
it up on Github soon, I just need to clean it up. And I'll probably get
back to doing this weekly now that it takes much closer to a few
minutes, than 15.
