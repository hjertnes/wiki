This is a archive of all the "likes" I have posted on my blog. I mark stuff I think is worth reading in Instapaper, and share a bunch each week


## 2019-01-10 {#2019-01-10}

I have been thinking a lot about how to share links over the last couple
of months. My old style was to add a post for each link. The reason I
used to do that was because it started as a Micropub like, and I just
kept doing it after I moved away from using Micropub. I have decided
that I as a reader would prefer that someone collected them and posted
it in one larger post instead of many smaller ones.

The way I consume content online these days is that anything that looks
even a little bit interesting are sent to Instapaper, and the stuff I
think was interesting or cool are marked as a favourite there. So what I
am going to do is that once a week I'll empty out my likes from
Instapaper and share them here.

It's a little bit weird, but I always think I don't read much in
Instapaper, but when I empty out my likes it always turns out to be a
lot more than I thought.

## 2019-04-12 {#2019-04-12}

A while since last time, I wanted to automate this process a little bit.
Then I didn't hear back from Instapaper about a API token and I went for
a less ideal solution. It is a lot better though. Long story short, I
wrote a node script that parses a exported csv files. I'll probably get
it up on Github soon, I just need to clean it up. And I'll probably get
back to doing this weekly now that it takes much closer to a few
minutes, than 15.

I tried looking into doing some basic categories on the links, and I didn't end up with anything useful. It was either a bunch of very small categories or too generic to be of any use. These links are intended to be a low effort way for me to just dump out everything I've read in the last week that I consider worth sharing.
