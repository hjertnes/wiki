## Card games {#card-games}

I'm not that into most card games, because they are too serious. But there are two games I think are really awesome, because you can basically just play them laugh and people can walk in and out of them without issues, while finding a new drink or making food.

-   Cards against humanity
-   Joking Hazard

CAH are the better of the two, because JH is a little bit more difficult for the jokes to make sense. But both of them are a lot of fun, and a great way to make holidays like christmas survivable

## Switch games {#switch-games}

List of all the games I have on my Switch and a few words about them.


### Inside {#inside}

A great game that I first played on my iPhone, good looking and a interesting game play. But it is really hard, and becomes a little bit weird at the end. But still worht it.


### Don't Starve {#don-t-starve}

I played this for a couple of days, it is great, but not really my kind of thing. The basic idea is that you need to collect items to stay alive and you unlock things as you go.


### Mario's Odessy {#mario-s-odessy}

This is probably the best first game for the Switch, not very hard but a lot of fun. My only issue with it is that it doesn't take that long to complete it. If you liked Mario 64 you'd love it.


### Celeste {#celeste}

A fantastic game, but I haven't gotten that far in it because it becomes really difficult.


### Rayman's Legends {#rayman-s-legends}

I haven't played this a lot, but I mostly got it because I loved the original.


### Sonic Mania {#sonic-mania}

I haven't played this


### Sonic Forces {#sonic-forces}

I haven't played this


### Sonic Sega Ages {#sonic-sega-ages}

I haven't played this.


### Let's Go Pikachu {#let-s-go-pikachu}

I loved this a lot, but it is just a modern version of the original Pokemon. Awesome, but I can't wait for the next real Pokemon. It might work as a good middle ground between Pokemon Go and the real games.


### Mariokart 8 {#mariokart-8}

I got this to have something to play with Ingri. Not really my thing.


### Splatoon 2 {#splatoon-2}

This is an awesome game. The game was a lot of fun to play, and the multiplayer is awesome if that's your thing.


### Civ 6 {#civ-6}

One of those games I got, but haven't played a lot.


### Hallow Knight {#hallow-knight}

This one looks fantastic, but it becomes very hard very fast.


### Crash {#crash}

I have played through the first and a lot of the second game. I used to really love the first one on PS1, and it is a great game if you want a lot of entertainment for your money.


### Donkey Kong {#donkey-kong}

A great game, but it is very hard or too easy. It would be much better with another level in between.


### Octopath Traveler {#octopath-traveler}

I like this game a lot, haven't played it a lot. But if you like Pokemon it is the perfect game for you.


### Stardew Valley {#stardew-valley}

This is the perfect game for just killing time. I have no idea how much commute time I have killed by playing this game.


### Baba is you {#baba-is-you}

I haven't played this a lot yet, but it seems like a cool puzzle game.


### Zelda {#zelda}

This is the best game on the Switch. It is so open, but it can be very frustrating. Also a fantastic game.


### Mario+Rabids {#mario-plus-rabids}

This is a very veird and very different Mario game. It is part puzzle, part shooting game. But it is one of the best games I have played in a long time.


### Mario Bros Delux {#mario-bros-delux}

This is my favourite Mario game on the Switch. Probably because it is closest to the original Mario games.


### Pode {#pode}

A really beautiful indie puzzle game.


### Firewatch {#firewatch}

I have just played it a little, and it looks great, but it feels like the kind of thing that works better on a PC.


### FF12 {#ff12}

Haven't played it yet


### Blades of Time {#blades-of-time}

I haven't played it a lot, but it isn't really my kind of thing. But still a great thing to play just to waste time.


## Text Editors {#text-editors}

-   Emacs: I use emacs for everything, and I love writing in it more than anyhting; it is freaking awesome on Mac OS and Linux; worse on Windows, but still great.
-   Rider: Some .NET development is more convenient in a IDE, for that I use rider.
-   Drafts: I use it a lot for capture notes and stuff I need to act on
-   iOS: because there are no real emacs for iOS is use a combination of Working Copy (a git client) and beorg on my iPhone.


## Watches {#watches}

-   Apple Watch Series 1 Space Gray with Black sportsband, red sportsband, and a Natoband
-   Apple Watch Series 3 Space Gray with Black sportsloop.
-   Seiko Quartz Watch (like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Seiko-Titanium-Sapphire-SGG733P1-SGG733P/dp/B003UFT8XC/ref=sxbs%5Fsxwds-stvp?fst=as%3Aoff&pd%5Frd%5Fi=B003UFT8XC&pd%5Frd%5Fr=5080ca36-4d23-4b7a-ae0c-beb30408b876&pd%5Frd%5Fw=OJbGM&pd%5Frd%5Fwg=xvOsF&pf%5Frd%5Fp=a6d018ad-f20b-46c9-8920-433972c7d9b7&pf%5Frd%5Fr=4GF56ZA0ZXV3ES0KGFZV&qid=1560074456&refinements=p%5Fn%5Ffeature%5Fthree%5Fbrowse-bin%3A2205662011%2Cp%5F89%3ASEIKO%2Cp%5Fn%5Fsize%5Ffour%5Fbrowse-vebin%3A6896053011%2Cp%5Fn%5Fmaterial%5Fbrowse%3A379295011&rnid=2205643011&s=apparel) except with silver instead of gold). It's small, light and can take more or less anything.

Currently using the Apple Watch Series 3, but I have gone back and forth between it and the Seiko for for the last six to seven months as of Januar 2020
