I'm not that into most card games, because they are too serious. But there are two games I think are really awesome, because you can basically just play them laugh and people can walk in and out of them without issues, while finding a new drink or making food.

-   Cards against humanity
-   Joking Hazard

CAH are the better of the two, because JH is a little bit more difficult for the jokes to make sense. But both of them are a lot of fun, and a great way to make holidays like christmas survivable
