I don't do much "tech" podcasts anymore. Used to listen to a million of them. Got sick of the echo chamber made by a bunch of rich white dudes.

Here is what I listen to:

-   Two Headed Girl
-   Top Four
-   Pragmatic
-   Go Time
-   Emacs Cast
-   Hardcore History
-   Hardcore History Addendum
-   Common Sense
-   Causality
-   Analytical
-   Revolutions
-   Reconcilable Differences
-   Literature and history
-   The History of Rome
-   The History of Ancient Greece
