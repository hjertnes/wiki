-   Emacs: I use emacs for everything, and I love writing in it more than anyhting; it is freaking awesome on Mac OS and Linux; worse on Windows, but still great.
-   Rider: Some .NET development is more convenient in a IDE, for that I use rider.
-   Drafts: I use it a lot for capture notes and stuff I need to act on
-   iOS: because there are no real emacs for iOS is use a combination of Working Copy (a git client) and beorg on my iPhone.
