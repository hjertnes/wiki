## Luna {#luna}

18th of May 2016 - 16th of July 2020; we first met her 16th of July 2016.

We drove all the way from the west coast of Norway to eastern Sweden to pick her up. And on the way back the clutch died like an hour after leaving. So Ingri, I, Luna and another puppy we were bringing back spent 12 hours ouside a un-manned gas station. After a bunch of stuff we were home Monday morning instead of Sunday afternoon.

Luna had a great life, except for the issues that lead to us having to make the hardest choice possible.

We haven't done almost anything over the last four years where we couldn't bring her, and if we didn't we always made sure to not stay too long because she was at home.

In retrospect I realize that she always have had some issues, and things may have turned out differently if we had dealth with them earlier. That is so easy to say now.

She was always really uncomfortable with me not being around, that slowly turned into her panicing when I left or was somewhere else in the house. And what started out as being a little bit scared slowly turned into agression at the end. After using countless hours on trying to solve it by training a lot(and getting help from dog trainers). Things were getting better for a while, and then it didn't anymore. We decided the best thing for everyone was to put her down.

We tried everything we could, until I was so tired I couldn't take it anymore. It broke me and my heart. I had to let my best friend die.

I am writing this the day after, and things is better. I'm less stressed. And our other dog seems to be more calm and relaxed.

We decided to give Luna the best day possible. I made some waffels for her the day before. And we went on a long walk in the morning, before we went up to Ingri's parents where she got to run out in their yard with Molly and their dog. Before we went down to the area with the vet and walked with her and gave her way too much waffles, before our apointment at the vet.

We went in, and petted her while crying as she got the first shot. And continued doing that until she fell asleep. Then Ingri left me as they gave Luna the final shot while I continued to pet her way past where she had left us.

It is really hard, but I know it is for the better. Everything reminds me of her. I guess I would have felt like this no matter when; but the thing I think is the sadest is that I could not make it work until she was of a age where I feel less terrible about it.

I lost my best friend, I'm completly crushed, and really sad. But everything feels easier now, and I have more time and energy to spend on our other dog and our daughter.


## On getting rid of podcasts {#on-getting-rid-of-podcasts}

Two months ago I got rid of all my podcasts, this was a result of a year and a half long process of removing more and more podcasts; and a few fallbacks.

It feels great to be without podcasts. They had their role at some point. But now it just feels like busy work, and it feels better to focus on audiobooks and music as entertainment.


## Why I get up early on weekends {#why-i-get-up-early-on-weekends}

I get to bed early because I get up really early (04:15 on weekdays, because I take the 05:40 train to the city and have to walk the dogs etc), and because I hate being tired.

So instead of breaking the rythm each weekend I don't push it too far and usually are up between 6 and 7 most weekends.

The dogs want to get up by that point anyways.

This change makes each monday much easier. And I get much more done every weekend.


## Do it right {#do-it-right}

When you write code (probably applies to a lot of other stuff) you can make something that just works or something good.

It is about doing it right.

It is about making it work well, being fast, fails gracefully, having tests. The code is clean.

Yout know, right.

At work, and other places I see too much of work that is just about getting something good enough that it is passable for something that can run in production.

It is crap, and it never pays off. Because someone always have to either stich it together over and over or do the work to fix it.

We need to stop this shit and do better work no matter how much pressure we have on ourself.

We should never do anything less than "right".


## What if I start to listen to podcasts again {#what-if-i-start-to-listen-to-podcasts-again}

I did not do so when I wrote donw the idea for this blog post, but I did a while after.
I re-installed Overcast. Deleted everything in there. And then I subscribed to everything Dan Carlin. But that is just like 3-4 podcasts per year.

And then I re-subscribed to Two Headed Girl.

That was about it. For a really long time. But when I got into learning myself Go I also subscribed to GoTime a weekly podcast about Go. And a while later Emacs cast.

At this point only one of them publish weekly or in any way regular. So I kind of just open Overcast once a month and listen if there are anything new.

I'm not at all back into podcasting. And I have zero interest in re-subscribing to any of the stuff I used to listen to.

Most of the Apple Tech stuff bore me to death.


## I work for money {#i-work-for-money}

I try to keep my work home life balanace as plain as possible. The reason I work is because of money. If I did not have to do that I would work on very different projects.

The way I look at it work pays for a certain amount of time per year. And I try to keep it as close to that amount as possible. But giving them moe than they pay for, for good will. But not a lot.

Unlike most people, I usually don't go to most work parties. I usually go to team parties, but I skip the whole company parties.

It would probably be different if I worked in a smaller company.


## Why I ended the inksmudge {#why-i-ended-the-inksmudge}

I have had some kind of a website online since 98 or 99.

At some point in 2010 or 2011 I decided that I would like to become a better writer, and I just started to write a lot.

Then I started to blog.

After trying to write about Apple and Tech for a really long time, I decided to try something different in 2015. So I started the InkSmudge. And after a tweet to Brad Dowdy of the Pen Addict 100 or 1000 times more traffic and subscribes than I ever had on any of my previous attempts.

Then I freaked out and used years to get comfortable with it.

For a really long time it made sense to have seperate web sites. But at this point it is just a bunch of extra work for me. And I have just continued writing a bunch of stuff for like a year even though I would have made more sense to combine the sites.

This means that I am going to write less about stationary stuff. But I'm still going to write some about it. And my overall goal is to continue writing 3 posts a week as I did when I had two different sites.
This section is like a blog, just without a rss feed. There are things like this in other parts. But these are stuff that formerly was under Personal. And they may move, but corrently don't have a better room


## Digital hoarding {#digital-hoarding}

I hate having stuff, just for having them. So in order to make the footprint of my "stuff" as small as possible, I try to review it often. On a regular basis I look over my apps, my files etc and I get rid of everything I don't use or need.

Old stuff fill up your disks, make your backups larger and may also expose you to security problems.

Just because you don't use something does not mean it may not expose you.


## Ordering with intention {#ordering-with-intention}

There are a lot of stuff around no matter what your hobby is that you could buy. I usually don't buy that many things that end up not working out for me.

The reason is that I have a really slow process that keeps me from buying most stuff. When I see something interesting I add it to a list I keep of all the shit I want to get. Then later I look over all of it and remove the stuff I didn't find interesting, and the rest are moved to another list. That one I also look at sometimes, and before I buy something (the exception here is entertainment) I need to find a place for it. If I can't find something I want to use it for, and a reason for not using something I already own (if anything is usable for it) I don't get it.

Like I said it is really slow, and most stuff are just ignored.

But it keeps me from wasting money on stuff.


## Minimalism {#minimalism}

Minimalism is something I think most people don't understand.

A lot of people think of it as having nothing. But that is not true. Minimalism is about having as little as possible. To get rid of everything that isn't essential.

The way I go about it is to try to get rid of everything that doesn't improve my life.

We all have a lot of stuff, that is just stuff. Doesn't improve our lives at all. That is the stuff to get rid of.

For me, minimalism is more about the practise of questioning everything rather than the act of having little stuff. \`\`


## Coffee stuff {#coffee-stuff}

I've been into coffee stuff for a long time. Almost ten years at this point. I don't do that much fancy stuff at the moment. Mostly just making the best possible coffee with good but inexpensive coffee from the store. Usually with a Moccamaster.

When I did more fancy stuff I used to do a lot of V60 at the end, before that I often did a lot of Aeropress or Moccapot.

The most important thing when it comes to coffee however is not the gear, but the coffee itself. Figure out what style you prefer and get gear that makes the best of that coffee. I'd get a good grinder, but my experience is that grinders usually either make good medium or good fine grained. The other gear are usually very inexpensive.


## Starting a company {#starting-a-company}

I've been wanting to start a indie software company since 2010 or something. I have started to actually looking into this. The idea is to start by turning some of if not most of my hobby projects into web products. The idea is to start off at $10 a year, and see where that takes me. My main goal for this is for it to not loose money.

Thoughts from the process of looking into it:

-   I should wait as long as possible, because every single month it is running costs money
-   It is amazing how something simple like a GitHub subscription affects the number of sales I need to not loose money
