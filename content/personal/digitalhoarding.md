I hate having stuff, just for having them. So in order to make the footprint of my "stuff" as small as possible, I try to review it often. On a regular basis I look over my apps, my files etc and I get rid of everything I don't use or need.

Old stuff fill up your disks, make your backups larger and may also expose you to security problems.

Just because you don't use something does not mean it may not expose you.
