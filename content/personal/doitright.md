When you write code (probably applies to a lot of other stuff) you can make something that just works or something good.

It is about doing it right.

It is about making it work well, being fast, fails gracefully, having tests. The code is clean.

Yout know, right.

At work, and other places I see too much of work that is just about getting something good enough that it is passable for something that can run in production.

It is crap, and it never pays off. Because someone always have to either stich it together over and over or do the work to fix it.

We need to stop this shit and do better work no matter how much pressure we have on ourself.

We should never do anything less than "right".
