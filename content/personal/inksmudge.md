I have had some kind of a website online since 98 or 99.

At some point in 2010 or 2011 I decided that I would like to become a better writer, and I just started to write a lot.

Then I started to blog.

After trying to write about Apple and Tech for a really long time, I decided to try something different in 2015. So I started the InkSmudge. And after a tweet to Brad Dowdy of the Pen Addict 100 or 1000 times more traffic and subscribes than I ever had on any of my previous attempts.

Then I freaked out and used years to get comfortable with it.

For a really long time it made sense to have seperate web sites. But at this point it is just a bunch of extra work for me. And I have just continued writing a bunch of stuff for like a year even though I would have made more sense to combine the sites.

This means that I am going to write less about stationary stuff. But I'm still going to write some about it. And my overall goal is to continue writing 3 posts a week as I did when I had two different sites.
This section is like a blog, just without a rss feed. There are things like this in other parts. But these are stuff that formerly was under Personal. And they may move, but corrently don't have a better room
