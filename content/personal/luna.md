18th of May 2016 - 16th of July 2020; we first met her 16th of July 2016.

We drove all the way from the west coast of Norway to eastern Sweden to pick her up. And on the way back the clutch died like an hour after leaving. So Ingri, I, Luna and another puppy we were bringing back spent 12 hours ouside a un-manned gas station. After a bunch of stuff we were home Monday morning instead of Sunday afternoon.

Luna had a great life, except for the issues that lead to us having to make the hardest choice possible.

We haven't done almost anything over the last four years where we couldn't bring her, and if we didn't we always made sure to not stay too long because she was at home.

In retrospect I realize that she always have had some issues, and things may have turned out differently if we had dealth with them earlier. That is so easy to say now.

She was always really uncomfortable with me not being around, that slowly turned into her panicing when I left or was somewhere else in the house. And what started out as being a little bit scared slowly turned into agression at the end. After using countless hours on trying to solve it by training a lot(and getting help from dog trainers). Things were getting better for a while, and then it didn't anymore. We decided the best thing for everyone was to put her down.

We tried everything we could, until I was so tired I couldn't take it anymore. It broke me and my heart. I had to let my best friend die.

I am writing this the day after, and things is better. I'm less stressed. And our other dog seems to be more calm and relaxed.

We decided to give Luna the best day possible. I made some waffels for her the day before. And we went on a long walk in the morning, before we went up to Ingri's parents where she got to run out in their yard with Molly and their dog. Before we went down to the area with the vet and walked with her and gave her way too much waffles, before our apointment at the vet.

We went in, and petted her while crying as she got the first shot. And continued doing that until she fell asleep. Then Ingri left me as they gave Luna the final shot while I continued to pet her way past where she had left us.

It is really hard, but I know it is for the better. Everything reminds me of her. I guess I would have felt like this no matter when; but the thing I think is the sadest is that I could not make it work until she was of a age where I feel less terrible about it.

I lost my best friend, I'm completly crushed, and really sad. But everything feels easier now, and I have more time and energy to spend on our other dog and our daughter.
