Minimalism is something I think most people don't understand.

A lot of people think of it as having nothing. But that is not true. Minimalism is about having as little as possible. To get rid of everything that isn't essential.

The way I go about it is to try to get rid of everything that doesn't improve my life.

We all have a lot of stuff, that is just stuff. Doesn't improve our lives at all. That is the stuff to get rid of.

For me, minimalism is more about the practise of questioning everything rather than the act of having little stuff. \`\`
