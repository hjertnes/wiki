I've been wanting to start a indie software company since 2010 or something. I have started to actually looking into this. The idea is to start by turning some of if not most of my hobby projects into web products. The idea is to start off at $10 a year, and see where that takes me. My main goal for this is for it to not loose money.

Thoughts from the process of looking into it:

-   I should wait as long as possible, because every single month it is running costs money
-   It is amazing how something simple like a GitHub subscription affects the number of sales I need to not loose money
