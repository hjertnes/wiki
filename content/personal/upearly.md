I get to bed early because I get up really early (04:15 on weekdays, because I take the 05:40 train to the city and have to walk the dogs etc), and because I hate being tired.

So instead of breaking the rythm each weekend I don't push it too far and usually are up between 6 and 7 most weekends.

The dogs want to get up by that point anyways.

This change makes each monday much easier. And I get much more done every weekend.
