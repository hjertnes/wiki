I try to keep my work home life balanace as plain as possible. The reason I work is because of money. If I did not have to do that I would work on very different projects.

The way I look at it work pays for a certain amount of time per year. And I try to keep it as close to that amount as possible. But giving them moe than they pay for, for good will. But not a lot.

Unlike most people, I usually don't go to most work parties. I usually go to team parties, but I skip the whole company parties.

It would probably be different if I worked in a smaller company.
