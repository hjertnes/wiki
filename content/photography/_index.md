## Analog photography tricks for everyone {#analog-photography-tricks-for-everyone}

Getting a manual 35mm film camera have been the thing I have learnt the most about photography from.

Having to adjust all the parameters manually have thought me how to work efficiently with them on all cameras.

You need to adjust shutter speed, f-stop and focus; and pick a ISO speed and stick to it for the entire film. Sometimes you use a film that is unusable for the situation and you need to change it. And that means wasting money.

What I do a lot of the time shooting analog  is that I set the shutter speed to 1/50th of a second, the slowest I can shoot handheld without having to think aobut it and then I just adjust f-spot. To make zooming easy I also a lot of them time always go for the biggest f-stop possible, unless I'm for some reason really want a shallow depth of field.
Back in my street shooting days I used to just pre-set everything and wait until some subject walked into the distanced I had zoomed for.

Oh yeah, and if you can shoot in f8 almost everything is in focus.

I placed a Contigo mug with the Autoseal system, because it was really hard to clean and the system broke down after about a year.


## Camera lens focal lengths {#camera-lens-focal-lengths}

These are some notes about my views on lens focal lengths. They are in 35mm, if you have a crop sensor like a Fuji or Nikon or Sony you need to divide it by 1.6 or multiply it to go the other way; or 1.5 for Canon. For example a 35mm on 35mm film is 23mm on a Fuji.

-   Fisheye: a fisheye should have 180 degrees of view, it is the widest you can go and keep a square image. I have one true 180 degrees one that is a 12mm.
-   35mm: I think this focal length is the perfect when you just want to walk around shooting snapshots
-   50mm: Great if you want a little bit more control of what's in the image than a 35; also great if you want soemthing that's good for both portraits and snapshots.
-   70-90mm: The perfect for portraits.

I prefer primes, because they are much easier to shoot with one handed; and I prefer the smallest lens possible over the lowest f-number possible


## Gear {#gear}

-   Fuji X-Pro 2 body
-   12x 16GB memory cards
-   3x batteries; two originals and one third party; the originals are better but not by much.
-   23mm f2
-   35mm f2
-   50mm f2
-   8mm f2.8 fisheye (third party)
-   Nikon FM analog
-   E series 50mm f1.8
-   24mm f/2.8
-   Usually HP5+ 400 pushed to 1600.


## Photograhy {#photograhy}

This is the gear I own, and below a short description of what I use at the moment:

-   Fuji X-Pro2
-   8mm f2.8
-   23mm f2
-   35mm f2
-   50mm f2
-   Nikon FM
-   50mm f1.8
-   24mm f2.8
-   Fuji X100T

These days I mostly shoot using my X-Pro2 and the 23mm, if I think I want more than one focal length I usually also bring the 50mm. I don't do anyhting with my RAW files at the moment I just shoot jpeg + raw using Acros film simulation, throw it into Apple Photos, but I keep the raw files for "just in case I change my mind".

Not doing a lot of analog at the moment. That might change.


## Photography workflow {#photography-workflow}

-   I Shoot in burst
-   When I have a few SD cards filled up I import them.

-   I make a folder with todays date
-   I rename the folder to DCIM1, DCIM2 etc before I copy it to the folder I created in step 1.
-   When I have copied all of them to my Mac, I run a script that moves all te jpg files to a JPEG folder and all the raw files to a RAW folder.
-   Then I copy it to my archive drive
-   After that I import the JPEG's into Photos.
-   Then I process them, usually delete 90% of the photos.
-   Export the once I kept to a folder called "Exported on DATE"
-   The Flickr uploadr will pick it up and upload it to Flickr
-   When all of that is done I delete te folder from my Mac and review the stuff uploaded to Flickr. Then I make all the stuff I want to be public public. The rest are left private for now.

Most of the time I have the 23mm on my X-Pro, if I'm going somewhere with it I usually also bring the 50mm; sometimes I bring the two other lenses but usually not. I usually bring all my batteries, and I have this SD card case that makes it easy to bring all my SD cards.

After years of being unhappy with the time I took and what I got out of it I have stopped my Lightroom based workflow I started shooting JPEG + RAW, add the jpegs to Apple Photos and process them, and I just stick the RAW's on an external drive. I shoot with the Acros preset on my camera.

I'm usually more happy with those results than I ever was with Lightroom.


## X-Pro 2 {#x-pro-2}

I have been using my X-Pro 2 for close to three years now. The 3 have have some cool features that I'd like, but I'm not getting it before this one breaks.

I love it as a camera, and I am never going back to a SLR style camera if I have a choice.

I enjoy shooting with it, and I love the photos I get out of it without any editing. The one thing I miss is better battery life. Not a huge issue, and it can be solved by carry and a few of them.
