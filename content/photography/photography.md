This is the gear I own, and below a short description of what I use at the moment:

-   Fuji X-Pro2
-   8mm f2.8
-   23mm f2
-   35mm f2
-   50mm f2
-   Nikon FM
-   50mm f1.8
-   24mm f2.8
-   Fuji X100T

These days I mostly shoot using my X-Pro2 and the 23mm, if I think I want more than one focal length I usually also bring the 50mm. I don't do anyhting with my RAW files at the moment I just shoot jpeg + raw using Acros film simulation, throw it into Apple Photos, but I keep the raw files for "just in case I change my mind".

Not doing a lot of analog at the moment. That might change.
