-   I Shoot in burst
-   When I have a few SD cards filled up I import them.

-   I make a folder with todays date
-   I rename the folder to DCIM1, DCIM2 etc before I copy it to the folder I created in step 1.
-   When I have copied all of them to my Mac, I run a script that moves all te jpg files to a JPEG folder and all the raw files to a RAW folder.
-   Then I copy it to my archive drive
-   After that I import the JPEG's into Photos.
-   Then I process them, usually delete 90% of the photos.
-   Export the once I kept to a folder called "Exported on DATE"
-   The Flickr uploadr will pick it up and upload it to Flickr
-   When all of that is done I delete te folder from my Mac and review the stuff uploaded to Flickr. Then I make all the stuff I want to be public public. The rest are left private for now.

Most of the time I have the 23mm on my X-Pro, if I'm going somewhere with it I usually also bring the 50mm; sometimes I bring the two other lenses but usually not. I usually bring all my batteries, and I have this SD card case that makes it easy to bring all my SD cards.

After years of being unhappy with the time I took and what I got out of it I have stopped my Lightroom based workflow I started shooting JPEG + RAW, add the jpegs to Apple Photos and process them, and I just stick the RAW's on an external drive. I shoot with the Acros preset on my camera.

I'm usually more happy with those results than I ever was with Lightroom.
