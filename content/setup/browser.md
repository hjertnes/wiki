My current browser setup is Firefox everywhere, except my iPhone where I'm on Safari.

This is my setup.

Extentions:

-   1Password X. I use it instead of the regular because it works everywhere including Linux
-   HTTPS Everywhere: Use SSL when available
-   Instapaper.
-   React Developer Tools
-   Redux DevTools
-   uBlock Origin

Various other settings:

-   Syncing settings and extentions
-   Delete cookies on restart
-   Strict tracker settings

Themes:

-   I use a custom one that I change way too often
