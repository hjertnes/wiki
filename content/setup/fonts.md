These are my goto text editor fonts, that I actually stick with in the long term.


## JetBrains Mono {#jetbrains-mono}


## Source Code Pro {#source-code-pro}

Source Code Pro was my go to, with a few others in between since I started to use a non default font in 2017. And I have now used the JetBrains font since it came out.
