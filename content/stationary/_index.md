## Back to the Blackwing {#back-to-the-blackwing}

I have not used a lot of Blackwing in last year or so. Because I thought they were overpriced. And that is still true.

I got two packs of them. One of the new natural version and a pack of the Bauhaus Volume edition.

They are great. Not a lot better than the Golden Bears I have been using. But they are very nice.

I might be using them for a while.


## Bad Paper {#bad-paper}

The common thing about al bad paper is that it kind of soaks up the ink instead of drying on top of it. A lot of people hate how it looks, and this is called feathering.

Bad paper can either be think causing things like fountain pens to bleed through multiple pages or have thicker paper where that usually don't happen.

I used to use bad thicker paper for a long time as my go to. The reason was that it was easy to buy locally and it dired way faster than better paper.


## Bullet Journaling {#bullet-journaling}

I use Bullet Journal as a Getting Things Done like system. Beacuse of details that does not matter a paper system like Bullet Journaling will never be fully compatible with GTD for many details that does not matter.


### Notation {#notation}

I use the Dashplus notation from Patrick Rhone instead of the offical one, because I like it better and I have used it since way before Bullet Journal was a thing.


### Paper and stuff {#paper-and-stuff}

I use a LT1917 A5 Hardcover Dotgrid notebook, in a Seed cover from Nock.co. And I use various fountain pens usually a Lamy 2000 or a Pilot Vanishing Point.

The notebooks I use have two markers, and I use them to mark the first page I still have open items and the last page I have written something. One of the things I do a lot of is to transition items or move them to a new page. This is because I think it becomes harder to manage it I get beyond 30 pages of things.


## How I Bullet Journal {#how-i-bullet-journal}

I use a modified version of the bullet journal system. Instead of the default notation I use the one of Dasplus because I had used it for a long time when Bullet Journal came along.

My goto notebook is a LT1917 A5 dotgrid.

I keep a daily log which is a list of the stuff I intend to do in a given day. And I see on wether they are crossed off or out if I did them or not. I keep a future log for stuff I'll do at some point and a inbox. And I keep a bunch of project collections.

I try to keep the number of pages I have in use limited. Usually less than 30. So I tranisiton stuff quite often. I usually do it when I see I have more than 5 pages that are all filled with completed stuff.

Usually once a week or so.


## I Love Lists {#i-love-lists}

I love making a list, then crossing things off, extending it etc.

People make fun of me for having all kinds of dumb lists. But they keep me organized and keep me going. And keep me sane.

## Nock.co Burton {#nock-dot-co-burton}

I recieved my Nock.co burton from the 2019 Penaddict kickstarter a while ago.

It is awesome. Since I got it, I have ditched the A5 Seed I used to have, and fit both of the notebooks I carry every day in a single case. And it also has room for the pens I use and it also has room for my Field Notes when I don't want to have it in my pocket.


## Notebooks {#notebooks}

These are the notebooks I currently use.

-   Leuchtturm1917 A5 Hardcover DotGrid Bullet Journal: use it for my bullet journal; it is my current GTD like system.
-   Leuchtturm1917 A5 Hardcover Lined: when I feel like writing blog posts, wiki pages etc on paper I do it here.
-   Leuchtturm1917 A5 Five Year Journal: I write a few lines in this one every day.
-   Leuchtturm1917 A5 Sketchbook for sketchnoting
-   Field Notes DotGrid: I use it for temporary notes. It is either stuff I capture or a temp list while going to the store etc. Everything I keep it in will either be checked off or moved somewhere else within a couple of days.
-   Rhodia A5 Dotpad: I use it at work. just somewhere to write notes while I work.


## Other pen stuff {#other-pen-stuff}

-   Classroom Friendly Sharpener
-   KUM Longpoint
-   KUM Masterpiece
-   Nock.co Pencil pouch
-   Nock.co Burton
-   [Bulb Syringe](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/goulet-bulb-syringe?variant=11884649873451). Awsome for pusing a lot of water through a pen fast, to clean it
-   [Syringe](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/goulet-5ml-ink-syringes?variant=11884650168363). I use these syringes to fill my converters because it enables me to fill them all the way to the top.


## Paper {#paper}

Good paper let the ink dry on top of the pages, while bad paper soaks it up.

Good paper has the advantage that it can be really think and not bleed through the page. While bad paper usually dries way faster.

That is the compromise. Most paper are somewhere between. LT1917 and Rhodia are two brands that do this very well, and manages to be very good and have very short dry time. They are kind of my go to paper.

In the past my go to have been "bad" paper with thick pages because of how fast it dries. Moleskine is a typical example of really bad paper. And Tomoe River is on the complete other side of the scale. The latter is great, but takes forever to dry and is because of that useless to me.
