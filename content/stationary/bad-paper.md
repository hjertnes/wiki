The common thing about al bad paper is that it kind of soaks up the ink instead of drying on top of it. A lot of people hate how it looks, and this is called feathering.

Bad paper can either be think causing things like fountain pens to bleed through multiple pages or have thicker paper where that usually don't happen.

I used to use bad thicker paper for a long time as my go to. The reason was that it was easy to buy locally and it dired way faster than better paper.
