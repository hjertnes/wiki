I have not used a lot of Blackwing in last year or so. Because I thought they were overpriced. And that is still true.

I got two packs of them. One of the new natural version and a pack of the Bauhaus Volume edition.

They are great. Not a lot better than the Golden Bears I have been using. But they are very nice.

I might be using them for a while.
