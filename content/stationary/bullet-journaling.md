I use Bullet Journal as a Getting Things Done like system. Beacuse of details that does not matter a paper system like Bullet Journaling will never be fully compatible with GTD for many details that does not matter.


## Notation {#notation}

I use the Dashplus notation from Patrick Rhone instead of the offical one, because I like it better and I have used it since way before Bullet Journal was a thing.


## Paper and stuff {#paper-and-stuff}

I use a LT1917 A5 Hardcover Dotgrid notebook, in a Seed cover from Nock.co. And I use various fountain pens usually a Lamy 2000 or a Pilot Vanishing Point.

The notebooks I use have two markers, and I use them to mark the first page I still have open items and the last page I have written something. One of the things I do a lot of is to transition items or move them to a new page. This is because I think it becomes harder to manage it I get beyond 30 pages of things.
