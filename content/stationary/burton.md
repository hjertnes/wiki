I recieved my Nock.co burton from the 2019 Penaddict kickstarter a while ago.

It is awesome. Since I got it, I have ditched the A5 Seed I used to have, and fit both of the notebooks I carry every day in a single case. And it also has room for the pens I use and it also has room for my Field Notes when I don't want to have it in my pocket.
