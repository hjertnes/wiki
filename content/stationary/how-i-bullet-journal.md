I use a modified version of the bullet journal system. Instead of the default notation I use the one of Dasplus because I had used it for a long time when Bullet Journal came along.

My goto notebook is a LT1917 A5 dotgrid.

I keep a daily log which is a list of the stuff I intend to do in a given day. And I see on wether they are crossed off or out if I did them or not. I keep a future log for stuff I'll do at some point and a inbox. And I keep a bunch of project collections.

I try to keep the number of pages I have in use limited. Usually less than 30. So I tranisiton stuff quite often. I usually do it when I see I have more than 5 pages that are all filled with completed stuff.

Usually once a week or so.
