These are the notebooks I currently use.

-   Leuchtturm1917 A5 Hardcover DotGrid Bullet Journal: use it for my bullet journal; it is my current GTD like system.
-   Leuchtturm1917 A5 Hardcover Lined: when I feel like writing blog posts, wiki pages etc on paper I do it here.
-   Leuchtturm1917 A5 Five Year Journal: I write a few lines in this one every day.
-   Leuchtturm1917 A5 Sketchbook for sketchnoting
-   Field Notes DotGrid: I use it for temporary notes. It is either stuff I capture or a temp list while going to the store etc. Everything I keep it in will either be checked off or moved somewhere else within a couple of days.
-   Rhodia A5 Dotpad: I use it at work. just somewhere to write notes while I work.
