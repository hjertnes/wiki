-   Classroom Friendly Sharpener
-   KUM Longpoint
-   KUM Masterpiece
-   Nock.co Pencil pouch
-   Nock.co Burton
-   [Bulb Syringe](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/goulet-bulb-syringe?variant=11884649873451). Awsome for pusing a lot of water through a pen fast, to clean it
-   [Syringe](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/goulet-5ml-ink-syringes?variant=11884650168363). I use these syringes to fill my converters because it enables me to fill them all the way to the top.
