Good paper let the ink dry on top of the pages, while bad paper soaks it up.

Good paper has the advantage that it can be really think and not bleed through the page. While bad paper usually dries way faster.

That is the compromise. Most paper are somewhere between. LT1917 and Rhodia are two brands that do this very well, and manages to be very good and have very short dry time. They are kind of my go to paper.

In the past my go to have been "bad" paper with thick pages because of how fast it dries. Moleskine is a typical example of really bad paper. And Tomoe River is on the complete other side of the scale. The latter is great, but takes forever to dry and is because of that useless to me.
