## ATH-M50x one year later. {#ath-m50x-one-year-later-dot}

I got a pair of Audio-technica m50x about a year ago. And they are awesome. Very comfortable. But I get a little bit sweaty when I use them for hours after hours after hours. But that isn't really somethin that could be solved without getting open backed ones.

I have that on my wish list, but not really sure when I'm going to pull the trigger on that.

But I really like them, and the only way I'd get much better comfort and quality would be if I went for some expensive headphones and amplifier togeter with a TIDAL or something.
If the dogs ate them today, I'd order another pair.


## Fiio BTR3 {#fiio-btr3}

I have used a bluetooth DAC from AFiio called Btr3 for over six months now. The reason I got it was because the experience of using a lightning to jack dongle while having my iPhone in a pocket was a miserable nightmare of disconnections all the time.

And I did not want a pair with bluetooth built in because the options are limited and expensive. Also because if the bluetooth break, you have to replace the whole thing.

The total price is about the same as the flagship headphones from Sony or Bose. But I think you can get much better headphones. And you can replace the bluetooth unit or the headphone unit independently.

The experience is a little bit worse. But I think the whole package is better.


## Flickr {#flickr}

I recently got back into Flickr, or Jack tempted me.

Instead of sharing photos on Micro.blog I upload them to flickr. For a while I shared them as album on my blog. But now I don't do that anymore. I treat Flickr more as a isolated "network". Those who want to see them follow me on Flickr the rest won't see it.

My workflow is simple, when I have processed them in Photos I export them to a new folder named like "Exported on 2020-01-01", and the flickr uploader picks it up and  uploads it all to a Album with the name of the folder. With the status of Private. Then later I look over it and make it public or some other sharing setting I seem appropriate.

I like it a lot. It feels a little bit like Instagram in a good way, but still works like a grown up photo sharing service.


## Git apps {#git-apps}

List of git apps I like

-   [Magit](https://magit.vc/manual/magit/): a git app for emacs that is really great.
-   [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/): works on Windows, Mac and Linux. It is awesome, makes almost everything I do with git easier. Like it's conflict resolution UI is AWESOME.


## How I use drafts {#how-i-use-drafts}

I use drafts when taking notes on paper is not working for me. And then I use it as a Inbox. And then at some later point and process it and either move it into my org-file system or to my bullet journal.

I also use it as a Inbox for my journal. And once in a while I move stuff from there into my real journal (also in org).

My current setup is really simple, I don't actually use any actions or anything. I just have two workspaces. One for the journal and one for the rest and a Shurtcut to add stuff to the journal section (I use a journal tag for it).


## I tried to fix a problem with my fish config {#i-tried-to-fix-a-problem-with-my-fish-config}

I had a problem with my fish config, that finally had gotten to the point where I had to fix it. I know when it was introduced (now), but didn't then. The result was that I in the process did something I have had on my to do list for a really long time.

I deleted everything. And re-wrote it. I also in the process got rid of everything I didn't really need that was in there because I thought it was "neat" when I first set up fish.

The problem was that it took several seconds to start a shell. And the reason this was happening was that in one of my path's I did something dumb that was a really heavy command inside it.


## iPhone 11 first impressions {#iphone-11-first-impressions}

-   The FaceID is more or less perfect, it works all the time, when it is resonable to expect it to
-   The UI changes of the monobrow phones are fine, still getting used to them. But they are not horrible
-   I do miss having battery life percentage always visible on the screen
-   And I prefer the old Apple Pay.


## Kindle {#kindle}

I have used a Kindle for a year now, and I really like it. And I have read way more books in the last year in a long time.

What I love about my kindle is that it is a thing that does one thing. Let me read books.

No other distractions.

And also the battery life is awesome.

Note to self: buy another the moment this one breaks


## Mastodon {#mastodon}

I played around on Mastodon.Social for a few hours after leaving Micro.blog, and I decided to give it a go so I got a domain and made my own instance on <https://dog.estate>. Curretly just me. But reach out if you want an account.

Here are some of my thoughts after being for a long time on Micro.blog

-   I hate re-tweets, boosts or what ever. Most of the time.
-   It is silly how they have cooked up their own terms for everything twitter
-   If you get a handle from someone like @JoeDouche@Bros.social and you want to check them out on their instance because that will have all of their posts something your instance probably won't. You first need to re-write it to bros.social/@JoeDouch and then back again if you wish to follow him or her. This process should be a lot better.
-   It feels a lot more like twitter. But not as horrible. More like twitter 10 years ago, than twitter 5 years ago.
-   I feel much more welcome here than Micro.blog

My handle is: @hjertnes@dog.estate.


## Micro.blog: my thoughts {#micro-dot-blog-my-thoughts}

This is not something I want to write, but I feel like I have to. And I'm pretty sure a lot of people will either complain or try to drag me into discussions I'm not that interested in having. The reason I do not actually want this is that I know how hard it is to develop products with limited resources.

This is just a collection of my feelings of Micro.blog after using it for multiple years.


### The people / the community {#the-people-the-community}

Most of the time most of the people I interact with are really nice, and those I don't enjoy I try to not interact with. But one thing that I don't like about the culture is that sometimes people reply to me complaining about my sarcasm, snark etc. I get that all of us should be nice most of the time. There are still a place for snark and other more "rude" or what ever you want to call them forms of communication. And some of us including myself, use this all the time.


### The native apps {#the-native-apps}

The apps are mostly the same as when I joined. It is as far as I can see mostly a web app wrapepd in some native UI. That was fine in the start. But at this point I expect more.


### The web interface / service {#the-web-interface-service}

The web interface is not great, and I think it is really weird. You have some parts that are the Micro.blog service and some of it is the hosted Micro.blog service.

Neither is great. The CMS admin functionality looks like an after thought. And a lot of the web interface is similar to the "apps", but they don't work the same way. Like in the apps you can post to micropub sites but not on the web site.


### The API {#the-api}

The API is to a large extent based on Indieweb standards. And that is awesome. But as far as I can see the API does not have a lot of great documentation. I have tried to push Manton towards Open API Specifications once. Which I think would be a step in the right direction. But I also think that one should be able to do an app with the same features as the official one (including push notificaitons) with the official API. And it is really ridicolus that a CORS issue with the API have  been open for like forever. This issue makes it impossible to make a web app that interacts with the API's without wrapping the API's in your own service.


### Open Issues {#open-issues}

In addition to the CORS issue, I have had this 24 hour clock issue with Micro.blog that I sent Manton within the first hour I used Micro.blog. Still not solved, and I suspect there are a lot more of them.


### Summary {#summary}

I think Micro.blog have become a good service, even though this post is really negative. But I think it is time to stop adding new stuff. And make what is good. And solve existing issues.


## No more RSS on my phone {#no-more-rss-on-my-phone}

A while back I replaced my feedbin plus various RSS apps with elfeed in emacs. This means that I no longer read rss on multiple computers. Just on my thinkpad, all in Emacs.

What I love about it is that I no longer focus on seeing everything. And that I do much less constant refreshing of various apps.


## On browsers {#on-browsers}

I use Firefox Developer Edition on my "real" computers and Safari on my iPhone.

Back when I used a Mac at work, my setup was usually Safari for browsing and Chrome for edevelopment and sometimes just Chrome or just Firefox.

These days I want all of my desktop browsing setup to be in one browsers, with support for syncing and all of that. I don't want to deal with keeping multiple setups kind of similar.

So I just use one browser.

Safari is a good browser, but isn't cross platform and their plugin development community isn't good enough.

Chrome isn't something I can support because I think Google and Facebook are evil

Brave is obviously out because it was funded by the father of Javascript who was fired from Mozilla because he was a homophobic asshole.

At this point I won't use anything that use Chromium as its base.

Mozilla is usually a company that line up with my concerns and opinions and the browser may not be as good as Chrome in some areas it is as good in like 95% of the time.

This is probably a loosing battle. But it feels good to take a stand.


## Properly cleaning up my RSS subscriptions {#properly-cleaning-up-my-rss-subscriptions}

When I moved from Feedbin to elfeed I also started to keep all my feeds in a org document. This have some advantages, one of them is that it is really easy to re-organize and delete stuff.

One of the first things I realized was that this list of subscriptions have been a add-only list since I first got into RSS back in 2005 or something. There as a ton of duplicates and dead sites and stuff I no longer cared about.

So I sat down, removed all the dupliates and sites I didn't care about anymore. The process of doing this in a text file was fast, and much more convenient than it would have been in some RSS syndication service.


## Rant about iOS keyboards {#rant-about-ios-keyboards}

Ever since Apple added the predictive keyboards to iOS all the new features have been limited to them. Like for example te 1Password integration or the swipe typing stuff.

All of that is great, but there are currently two "classes" of language support in iOS, those who have support for predictive typing and those who don't have.

After all of this time I think it is 100% bullshit. I think stuff like this is fine for up to three years. After that Apple should be ashamed of themselves.


## Synology {#synology}

I'm finally doing it.

I have this pile of external drive. But since the USB-C MacBook Pro it haven't worked that well. And since I got into Plex I have more and more felt that I would like for Plex and my data to be on this server thingy disconnected from my laptop.

It is way more expensive, at least in the beginning. But I hope that it will be worth it.


## This is how I do email on my phone {#this-is-how-i-do-email-on-my-phone}

So I don't like to use a lot of time refreshing inboxes and shit on my phone. That is why  stopped listening to podcasts and it is the reason I don't have RSS on my phone.

So, I use Mail.app for email on my phone. But I don't leave the accounts active. So when I need to do something with eiter my work or my private account. I go into settings enable it an then I do what ever I had to and then I disable it again.

It isn't very annoying. But just enough for me to never sit there and refresh my inboxes.


## VPN's {#vpn-s}

I use a VPN service on my iPhone and my MacBook. Mostly because I think it is a good idea, when I'm not on my home network. As a added bonus it also let me access my Mastodon instance on my personal devices at work. For some dumb ass reason they block it.

This is what I think about VPN services

-   Free: this is a really bad idea and stay away. It is like if you installed a tracker from Facebook on all your devices.
-   Paid: mostly the same, some feature varies but they are mostly the same. I used to use Encrypt.me but changed to Nord because they let me pick country I want to VPN through. There are some that are much more secure than the others, but that's not something I care that much about.


## Why I hate Open Source participation {#why-i-hate-open-source-participation}

<https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el#maintenance-warning>

> I use this package every day, and have been doing so for years. It just works. At least, it works for all my use cases. And if it breaks somehow, I fix it.
>
> However, it has become painfully clear to me that I don't have time to fix problems I don't have. It's been years since I could keep pace with the issues and pull requests. Whenever I try, I keep getting feedback that my fix isn't good enough by some standard I don't particularly care about.
>
> So, I have closed the issue tracker and the pull requests. I hope you can happily use this package, just like I do. If it doesn't work for you, then I'm sorry. Thankfully Emacs is infinitely malleable, you can probably fix it yourself.
>
> TLDR: I am still maintaining this package, but I am no longer crowdsourcing a list of issues.


## Why I stopped listening to podcasts. {#why-i-stopped-listening-to-podcasts-dot}

When I first got into podcasts for the second time I loved it. They were all fresh it felt like this counter culture revolution of radio. And I loved it for a long time. I from 2010 or 2011 until 2018 it was a majority of what I listened to, everything in periods.

But at some point, it got boring. It just felt like the same shit over and over. Too mnay podcasts talking about the same shit. Or entire series of podcasts just talking about the same thing from different angles.

So I started to get rid of podcasts. And some I added back and then I removed them again.

From easter 2018 until August of 2019 I removed stuff, and when I had 2 or 3 left I decided to just get rid of them entirely.

I might get back into it at some point. But as I am writing this in the end of October 2019 I don't think it will happen in a while.

And I love using the time I previously used on podcasts to listen to audioboks and Music.

I have started to really expolore genres I previously didn't have much exposure to (by choice). I don't really expose myself to TV, radio or anything the rest of the world are following.


## xxiivv {#xxiivv}

There is this guy on [https://merveilles.town/@neauoire]({{< relref "mastodon" >}}), and <https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html> that really annoy me. At first glance he is a interesting guy who does his website in C to save energy (makes sense?) and lives off the grid on a boat.

But I think he is just a poor mans RMS. His off the grid life is not that off the grid when you take into consideration that he makes a living from Patreon supporters. And the energy he saves from writing his website in C instead of something else staticly generated pales when you take into consideration that he use a Mastodon instance

If you just ignore all his personal flaws and look at RMS's no compromise on privacy and open source it's amazing the lengths he have been willing to go in order to live a Open Source existance without giving up his privacy.

This guy is just a pale imitation. And most of his views on stuff like eating meat and a like is just plain eco facism that makes the progress to carbon neutral or negative or what ever we need to go much harder.

I just think people like these are privileged assholes who live off their followers.
