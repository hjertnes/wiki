Ever since Apple added the predictive keyboards to iOS all the new features have been limited to them. Like for example te 1Password integration or the swipe typing stuff.

All of that is great, but there are currently two "classes" of language support in iOS, those who have support for predictive typing and those who don't have.

After all of this time I think it is 100% bullshit. I think stuff like this is fine for up to three years. After that Apple should be ashamed of themselves.
