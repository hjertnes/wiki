-   The FaceID is more or less perfect, it works all the time, when it is resonable to expect it to
-   The UI changes of the monobrow phones are fine, still getting used to them. But they are not horrible
-   I do miss having battery life percentage always visible on the screen
-   And I prefer the old Apple Pay.
