I have used a Kindle for a year now, and I really like it. And I have read way more books in the last year in a long time.

What I love about my kindle is that it is a thing that does one thing. Let me read books.

No other distractions.

And also the battery life is awesome.

Note to self: buy another the moment this one breaks
