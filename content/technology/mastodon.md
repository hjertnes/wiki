I played around on Mastodon.Social for a few hours after leaving Micro.blog, and I decided to give it a go so I got a domain and made my own instance on <https://dog.estate>. Curretly just me. But reach out if you want an account.

Here are some of my thoughts after being for a long time on Micro.blog

-   I hate re-tweets, boosts or what ever. Most of the time.
-   It is silly how they have cooked up their own terms for everything twitter
-   If you get a handle from someone like @JoeDouche@Bros.social and you want to check them out on their instance because that will have all of their posts something your instance probably won't. You first need to re-write it to bros.social/@JoeDouch and then back again if you wish to follow him or her. This process should be a lot better.
-   It feels a lot more like twitter. But not as horrible. More like twitter 10 years ago, than twitter 5 years ago.
-   I feel much more welcome here than Micro.blog

My handle is: @hjertnes@dog.estate.
