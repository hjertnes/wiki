A while back I replaced my feedbin plus various RSS apps with elfeed in emacs. This means that I no longer read rss on multiple computers. Just on my thinkpad, all in Emacs.

What I love about it is that I no longer focus on seeing everything. And that I do much less constant refreshing of various apps.
