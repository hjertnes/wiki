I'm finally doing it.

I have this pile of external drive. But since the USB-C MacBook Pro it haven't worked that well. And since I got into Plex I have more and more felt that I would like for Plex and my data to be on this server thingy disconnected from my laptop.

It is way more expensive, at least in the beginning. But I hope that it will be worth it.
