I use drafts when taking notes on paper is not working for me. And then I use it as a Inbox. And then at some later point and process it and either move it into my org-file system or to my bullet journal.

I also use it as a Inbox for my journal. And once in a while I move stuff from there into my real journal (also in org).

My current setup is really simple, I don't actually use any actions or anything. I just have two workspaces. One for the journal and one for the rest and a Shurtcut to add stuff to the journal section (I use a journal tag for it).
