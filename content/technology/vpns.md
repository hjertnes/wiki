I use a VPN service on my iPhone and my MacBook. Mostly because I think it is a good idea, when I'm not on my home network. As a added bonus it also let me access my Mastodon instance on my personal devices at work. For some dumb ass reason they block it.

This is what I think about VPN services

-   Free: this is a really bad idea and stay away. It is like if you installed a tracker from Facebook on all your devices.
-   Paid: mostly the same, some feature varies but they are mostly the same. I used to use Encrypt.me but changed to Nord because they let me pick country I want to VPN through. There are some that are much more secure than the others, but that's not something I care that much about.
