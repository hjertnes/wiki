      <p>I'm Eivind, this is my wiki. Here is by <a href="https://hjertnes.blog">blog</a> and this is my only social media thing <a href="https://dog.estate/@hjertnes"><span class="citation" data-cites="hjertnes">@hjertnes</span></a>.</p>
      <p>I live at Stanghelle, right outside Bergen, Norway with my dogs and fiancè.</p>
      <p>I currently work as a web developer, mostly using JavaScript, React and C#; in the past I have done a lot of PHP and Python. These days I mostly do Golang for fun. I have also done other kinds of work in past, mainly fundraising, bartending and IT work.</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>I'm not sure what I am doing here. Anyways. I thought the <a href="https://rudimentarylathe.org/">one</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/jack"><span class="citation" data-cites="jack">@jack</span></a> have was very cool. The basic idea is that I'll just fill up this wiki with interesting stuff. Everything that isn't a blog post will probably end up here.</p>
      <p>As I have been adding more stuff and extending this place I think this might replace my blog for a lot of stuff. Instead of writing blog posts this will probably turned into a nested structure of notes I do some extent keep updated.</p>
      <p>It is made with org-mode, pandoc and netlify</p>
      <p>It is generated from <a href="https://github.com/hjertnes/wiki/blob/master/wiki.org">this</a> org-file</p>

      <h2>Starting a company</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-04-09 15:04:45</p>
      <p>I've been wanting to start a indie software company since 2010 or something. I have started to actually looking into this. The idea is to start by turning some of if not most of my hobby projects into web products. The idea is to start off at $10 a year, and see where that takes me. My main goal for this is for it to not loose money.</p>
      <p>Thoughts from the process of looking into it:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>I should wait as long as possible, because every single month it is running costs money</li>
      <li>It is amazing how something simple like a GitHub subscription affects the number of sales I need to not loose money</li>

      <h2>Coffee stuff</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-04-26 19:04:64</p>
      <p>I've been into coffee stuff for a long time. Almost ten years at this point. I don't do that much fancy stuff at the moment. Mostly just making the best possible coffee with good but inexpensive coffee from the store. Usually with a Moccamaster.</p>
      <p>When I did more fancy stuff I used to do a lot of V60 at the end, before that I often did a lot of Aeropress or Moccapot.</p>
      <p>The most important thing when it comes to coffee however is not the gear, but the coffee itself. Figure out what style you prefer and get gear that makes the best of that coffee. I'd get a good grinder, but my experience is that grinders usually either make good medium or good fine grained. The other gear are usually very inexpensive.</p>

      <p>I had a problem with my fish config, that finally had gotten to the point where I had to fix it. I know when it was introduced (now), but didn't then. The result was that I in the process did something I have had on my to do list for a really long time.</p>
      <p>I deleted everything. And re-wrote it. I also in the process got rid of everything I didn't really need that was in there because I thought it was "neat" when I first set up fish.</p>
      <p>The problem was that it took several seconds to start a shell. And the reason this was happening was that in one of my path's I did something dumb that was a really heavy command inside it.</p>

      <p>I use a VPN service on my iPhone and my MacBook. Mostly because I think it is a good idea, when I'm not on my home network. As a added bonus it also let me access my Mastodon instance on my personal devices at work. For some dumb ass reason they block it.</p>
      <p>This is what I think about VPN services</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Free: this is a really bad idea and stay away. It is like if you installed a tracker from Facebook on all your devices.</li>
      <li>Paid: mostly the same, some feature varies but they are mostly the same. I used to use Encrypt.me but changed to Nord because they let me pick country I want to VPN through. There are some that are much more secure than the others, but that's not something I care that much about.</li>

At first glance he is a interesting guy who does his website in C to save energy (makes sense?) and lives off the grid on a boat.</p>
      <p>But I think he is just a poor mans RMS. His off the grid life is not that off the grid when you take into consideration that he makes a living from Patreon supporters. And the energy he saves from writing his website in C instead of something else staticly generated pales when you take into consideration that he use a Mastodon instance</p>
      <p>If you just ignore all his personal flaws and look at RMS's no compromise on privacy and open source it's amazing the lengths he have been willing to go in order to live a Open Source existance without giving up his privacy.</p>
      <p>This guy is just a pale imitation. And most of his views on stuff like eating meat and a like is just plain eco facism that makes the progress to carbon neutral or negative or what ever we need to go much harder.</p>

You first need to re-write it to bros.social/<span class="citation" data-cites="JoeDouch">@JoeDouch</span> and then back again if you wish to follow him or her. This process should be a lot better.</li>
      <li>It feels a lot more like twitter. But not as horrible. More like twitter 10 years ago, than twitter 5 years ago.</li>

      <p>However, it has become painfully clear to me that I don't have time to fix problems I don't have. It's been years since I could keep pace with the issues and pull requests. Whenever I try, I keep getting feedback that my fix isn't good enough by some standard I don't particularly care about.</p>
      <p>So, I have closed the issue tracker and the pull requests. I hope you can happily use this package, just like I do. If it doesn't work for you, then I'm sorry. Thankfully Emacs is infinitely malleable, you can probably fix it yourself.</p>

      <h2>Water Bottle</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>I have owne a number of plastic water bottles over the years, including multiple from contigo.</p>
      <p>And while I was happy with them, they were in no way perfect. So in the end of 2018 I decided to order a tripple walled bottle from 24 Bottles.</p>
      <p>I got the "climate" bottle, it has two layers of insulation keep cold water cold for 24 hours and hot stuff hot for 12.</p>
      <p>I went with a black one with the largest capacity available. My only regret is that I did not get one without paint on it. Becase it isn't the kind of finish that look cool as it's worn down.</p>
      <p>I love this bottle, I can fill it with ice after dinner and still have some left when I get home from work.</p>
      <p>This is the kind of bottle I don't see myself having to replace in a very long time. You could probably drive a car over it and still use it after.</p>
      <p>The default lid is very old school and sturdy, but you have to screw and unscrew it. It is what I have used since I got mine close to a year ago. But I have ordered one of the new sport lids that is more like regular water bottles where you don't have to unscrew it.</p>
      <p>I strongly recommend getting one from 24 Bottles.</p>
      <p>What I like about it is that unlike the plastic bottles the water never gets hot. This was a huge issue when I used a plastic bottle in the office.</p>

      <p>When I moved from Feedbin to elfeed I also started to keep all my feeds in a org document. This have some advantages, one of them is that it is really easy to re-organize and delete stuff.</p>
      <p>One of the first things I realized was that this list of subscriptions have been a add-only list since I first got into RSS back in 2005 or something. There as a ton of duplicates and dead sites and stuff I no longer cared about.</p>
      <p>So I sat down, removed all the dupliates and sites I didn't care about anymore. The process of doing this in a text file was fast, and much more convenient than it would have been in some RSS syndication service.</p>

      <h2>Why I stopped listening to podcasts.</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>When I first got into podcasts for the second time I loved it. They were all fresh it felt like this counter culture revolution of radio. And I loved it for a long time. I from 2010 or 2011 until 2018 it was a majority of what I listened to, everything in periods.</p>
      <p>But at some point, it got boring. It just felt like the same shit over and over. Too mnay podcasts talking about the same shit. Or entire series of podcasts just talking about the same thing from different angles.</p>
      <p>So I started to get rid of podcasts. And some I added back and then I removed them again.</p>
      <p>From easter 2018 until August of 2019 I removed stuff, and when I had 2 or 3 left I decided to just get rid of them entirely.</p>
      <p>I might get back into it at some point. But as I am writing this in the end of October 2019 I don't think it will happen in a while.</p>
      <p>And I love using the time I previously used on podcasts to listen to audioboks and Music.</p>
      <p>I have started to really expolore genres I previously didn't have much exposure to (by choice). I don't really expose myself to TV, radio or anything the rest of the world are following.</p>

      <p>All of that is great, but there are currently two "classes" of language support in iOS, those who have support for predictive typing and those who don't have.</p>

I have tried to push Manton towards <a href="">Open API Specifications</a> once. Which I think would be a step in the right direction. But I also think that one should be able to do an app with the same features as the official one (including push notificaitons) with the official API. And it is really ridicolus that a CORS issue with the API have been open for like forever. This issue makes it impossible to make a web app that interacts with the API's without wrapping the API's in your own service.</p>

      <p>So I just use one browser.</p>
      <p>Safari is a good browser, but isn't cross platform and their plugin development community isn't good enough.</p>
      <p>Chrome isn't something I can support because I think Google and Facebook are evil</p>
      <p>Brave is obviously out because it was funded by the father of Javascript who was fired from Mozilla because he was a homophobic asshole.</p>
      <p>At this point I won't use anything that use Chromium as its base.</p>
      <p>Mozilla is usually a company that line up with my concerns and opinions and the browser may not be as good as Chrome in some areas it is as good in like 95% of the time.</p>

      <p>My current setup is really simple, I don't actually use any actions or anything. I just have two workspaces. One for the journal and one for the rest and a Shurtcut to add stuff to the journal section (I use a journal tag for it).</p>

      <h2>Do it right</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>When you write code (probably applies to a lot of other stuff) you can make something that just works or something good.</p>
      <p>It is about doing it right.</p>
      <p>It is about making it work well, being fast, fails gracefully, having tests. The code is clean.</p>
      <p>Yout know, right.</p>
      <p>At work, and other places I see too much of work that is just about getting something good enough that it is passable for something that can run in production.</p>
      <p>It is crap, and it never pays off. Because someone always have to either stich it together over and over or do the work to fix it.</p>
      <p>We need to stop this shit and do better work no matter how much pressure we have on ourself.</p>
      <p>We should never do anything less than "right".</p>

      <p>I'm finally doing it.</p>
      <p>I have this pile of external drive. But since the USB-C MacBook Pro it haven't worked that well. And since I got into Plex I have more and more felt that I would like for Plex and my data to be on this server thingy disconnected from my laptop.</p>
      <p>It is way more expensive, at least in the beginning. But I hope that it will be worth it.</p>

      <p>I enjoy the story as fiction. As a philosophy major I can say that there is no good philosophy in there.</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>I recently got a Malcom Gladwell Audio Book called "Talking to strangers". And I really loved it.</p>
      <p>I know he isn't that great, or original. But I really enjoy just getting one of his books and wasting a few hours.</p>
      <p>And I always end up with some interesting idea or five out of his books.</p>
      <p>Some people get too hung up in the deatils. Like the 10 000 hours thing. What I took from it was that "most stuff requires a lot of hard work".</p>

      <h2>What if I start to listen to podcasts again</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>I did not do so when I wrote donw the idea for this blog post, but I did a while after. I re-installed Overcast. Deleted everything in there. And then I subscribed to everything Dan Carlin. But that is just like 3-4 podcasts per year.</p>
      <p>And then I re-subscribed to Two Headed Girl.</p>
      <p>That was about it. For a really long time. But when I got into learning myself Go I also subscribed to GoTime a weekly podcast about Go. And a while later Emacs cast.</p>
      <p>At this point only one of them publish weekly or in any way regular. So I kind of just open Overcast once a month and listen if there are anything new.</p>
      <p>I'm not at all back into podcasting. And I have zero interest in re-subscribing to any of the stuff I used to listen to.</p>
      <p>Most of the Apple Tech stuff bore me to death.</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>I try to keep my work home life balanace as plain as possible. The reason I work is because of money. If I did not have to do that I would work on very different projects.</p>
      <p>The way I look at it work pays for a certain amount of time per year. And I try to keep it as close to that amount as possible. But giving them moe than they pay for, for good will. But not a lot.</p>
      <p>Unlike most people, I usually don't go to most work parties. I usually go to team parties, but I skip the whole company parties.</p>
      <p>It would probably be different if I worked in a smaller company.</p>

      <h2>Why I ended the inksmudge</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>I have had some kind of a website online since 98 or 99.</p>
      <p>At some point in 2010 or 2011 I decided that I would like to become a better writer, and I just started to write a lot.</p>
      <p>Then I started to blog.</p>
      <p>After trying to write about Apple and Tech for a really long time, I decided to try something different in 2015. So I started the InkSmudge. And after a tweet to Brad Dowdy of the Pen Addict 100 or 1000 times more traffic and subscribes than I ever had on any of my previous attempts.</p>
      <p>Then I freaked out and used years to get comfortable with it.</p>
      <p>For a really long time it made sense to have seperate web sites. But at this point it is just a bunch of extra work for me. And I have just continued writing a bunch of stuff for like a year even though I would have made more sense to combine the sites.</p>
      <p>This means that I am going to write less about stationary stuff. But I'm still going to write some about it. And my overall goal is to continue writing 3 posts a week as I did when I had two different sites. This section is like a blog, just without a rss feed. There are things like this in other parts. But these are stuff that formerly was under Personal. And they may move, but corrently don't have a better room</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-05-01 15:00:00</p>
      <p>I hate having stuff, just for having them. So in order to make the footprint of my "stuff" as small as possible, I try to review it often. On a regular basis I look over my apps, my files etc and I get rid of everything I don't use or need.</p>
      <p>Old stuff fill up your disks, make your backups larger and may also expose you to security problems.</p>
      <p>Just because you don't use something does not mean it may not expose you.</p>

      <h2>Ordering with intention</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-05-01 15:00:00</p>
      <p>There are a lot of stuff around no matter what your hobby is that you could buy. I usually don't buy that many things that end up not working out for me.</p>
      <p>The reason is that I have a really slow process that keeps me from buying most stuff. When I see something interesting I add it to a list I keep of all the shit I want to get. Then later I look over all of it and remove the stuff I didn't find interesting, and the rest are moved to another list. That one I also look at sometimes, and before I buy something (the exception here is entertainment) I need to find a place for it. If I can't find something I want to use it for, and a reason for not using something I already own (if anything is usable for it) I don't get it.</p>
      <p>Like I said it is really slow, and most stuff are just ignored.</p>
      <p>But it keeps me from wasting money on stuff.</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>I'm not that into most card games, because they are too serious. But there are two games I think are really awesome, because you can basically just play them laugh and people can walk in and out of them without issues, while finding a new drink or making food.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Cards against humanity</li>
      <li>Joking Hazard</li>
      </ul>
      <p>CAH are the better of the two, because JH is a little bit more difficult for the jokes to make sense. But both of them are a lot of fun, and a great way to make holidays like christmas survivable</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-04-26 19:04:64</p>
      <p>Golang isn't OOP, but one type can inherit from another, for example to extend it properties. It is for example used to have your own custom context in the router I use called Echo.</p>
      <p>The way you usually set properties on types when you do this when TypeB inherit from TypeA is something like &amp;TypeB{typeAValue}. But sometimes you need to specify the properties. Then you need to do it like this &amp;TypeB{TypeA: typeAValue}.</p>

      <p>A enviornment variable is a variable managed my the OS. It is my favourite way to configure stuff like docker containers etc. The reason it is awesome is that it is way easier to manage than files for stuff that vary in environments. Config files are fine for stuff that are always the fine, but I kind of think it is better to just hardcode it unless you'll actually change it. ]</p>

      <h2>Literate programming using Org-mode and Emacs-lisp</h2>
      <p>I decided to get more into literate programming using org-mode. What I will be doing here is to take the first table, run it through the code in the middle to show fail and pass based on if the mark is 50 or higher. Because the way org exporting works, you have to look in the org file this have been generated <a href="https://github.com/hjertnes/wiki/blob/master/wiki.org">from</a> to see everything.</p>
      <p>The way this works is that we give the input data the name "students", then this is passed into our emacs lisp code as a list of lists. One list for the row, and it contains a list of the columns. Then the data that function returns show up as a table below.</p>
      <p>You can use a bunch of other languages than emacs-lisp like ruby, python, bash or javascript</p>

      <h2>Redux like pattern with ClojureScript and Reagent</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>Below is a super minimal version of a redux like pattern (if you use combine reducers in redux). If you want a full example of how it works you can see it in use in this <a href="https://github.com/hjertnes/bank2">repo</a> that I originally wrote it for.</p>
      <p>The way it works is that you define a hashmap of reducers, each reducer take state and a action as input, then it either returns the previous state (if the actions isn't something it can do anything about) or a new version of it state. It will always run an action through all of the reducers.</p>
      <p>It is written in a way where you decide all the logic yourself. The way I do it is that if you pass it nil default state is returned. First you create the store, then you create the dispatch method; the dispatch is used to send action to the store. The store is a single atom. I'm not sure how well this scales, but my approach is as always to start simple and see where it explodes.</p>

      <p>There is two things you need to keep in mind while working with EF</p>
      <ul>
      <li>One query going on per "request" at a time; in other words, if you loop over some rest and then need to do some queries inside that loop, you need to do a .ToList() or similar before starting the loop.</li>
      <li>If you a .ToList, ToArray, First or anything like that it will query the database, and if you run SaveChanges or SaveChanges async it will write data to the database. You want to make sure you only query the database as late as possible and that you save the context as infrequent as possible. I usually do it once per API request.</li>

      <p>All of this have been cleaned up in C# with a optional feature called nullable reference types.</p>
      <p>It means that any time a value could be null you need to declare it as nullable. And you'll get compiler warnings if you don't deal with the null stuff properly.</p>

      <p>Swagger or OpenAPISpecification is the way to specs or documentation for Restful web services.</p>
      <p>You can write the spec first, and then generate interfaces and models from it or you can generate the spec from your code. Both ways are fine.</p>
      <p>I think all web services should use Open API Sepcs. Becase you can auto generate client code and all kinds of cool stuff.</p>
      <p>Let's say you write an API, and then you're going to write a web app, an iOS app and maybe some android thing later.</p>
      <p>With an OpenAPI spec you could autogenerate the clients for all of them, and move on to focusing on making the apps instead of writing HttpClient code.</p>

      <p>You should either throw exceptions for this or return null values (if you use something where that is the native thing, like in Go).</p>
      <p>These kinds of stuff should be explicit because it leads to better code that are easier to change and extend.</p>

      <p>Both makefils and npm to a lesser degree let you declare tasks that are commonly done to a software project. Like "run", "clean", "build" or "lint".</p>
      <p>I think they are awesome, because "npm run lint" or "make lint" is possible to remember after seeing it once, while npx eslint –fix "some blob of patterns of files to include" is not.</p>
      <p>I personally prefer make files to the package.json format for a number of reasons. For one it is a old and well known standard way of doing things, it is a lot more flexible in terms of writing the tasks. And it works on more or less anything.</p>

      <h2>A retrospective after my Clojure experiment</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>I think Clojure is a great langauge, but too much of it is a mess.</p>
      <p>For example. There is not a good system for if a package is regular clojure only or clojurescript only or works with both. And a lot of the time you end up with packages that are a wrapper around for example the native dattime library of either, and not a common sensible abstraction that works on both systems.</p>
      <p>Another major problem is how much work it is to figure out how to start a project, install some packages, make something and then build it for production.</p>
      <p>Some templates are out dated others are not. Some works others not. And it is far from as easy as with other systems to just make it and use it.</p>
      <p>If you compare it to Go, .Net Core or React the three things I have spent the most time on outside Clojure over the last 5 years or so. I have built complex stuff in less time than I managed to do a proper production build of a POC frontend in Clojurescript or a POC rest API with Clojure.</p>
      <p>Again. I love the language, and I think it has some great ideas. But for me at this point, it isn't a good fit. Because I'd rather make stuff than to fight tooling and bullshit that should be solved out of te box.</p>

      <p>Helm and ivy are two very popular emacs packages, that for the most part does the same thing. They provide partical completion / search stuff. Like for example when you tyype M-x. Helm is bigger, heavier and slower. But it works out of the box, and the initial setup is much easier. Ivy on the other hand feels much faster, but requires more config. Most people probably start with Helm. I used it for a long time, but once I got into it and figured out the config I greatly prefer Ivy because of how snappy it is</p>

      <p>Okay. So most of my shit is oriented through different git repositories. And the most important part of that workflow is projectile M-p p to switch project or M-p SPC to search for a file.</p>
      <p>Because of this, it is much more natural for me to use projectile than something like deft. And I prefer having a few larger org documents instead of the a million different files concept that deft, roam and more use. It was popularized by notational velocity.</p>

      <p>The simple solution to this problem is to delete the elpa folder in your .emacs.d and restart emacs. This will force emacs to (if everything is set up correctly) to refresh the package lists (when you run the package-refresh-contents command it stores a local copy of the list of packages on each package mirror you have in your config), then it will install everything you have told it to install.</p>
      <p>If you don't want to do that, or you manually install packages instead of doing it in your config (bad idea), then doing the steps as described <a href="file:///emacs/packages">here</a> should fix it.</p>
      <p>I usually just nuke elpa and restart because it is faster.</p>

      <h2>Lisp: let and let*</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>Let is probably the feature of lisp that I miss the most in other languages. A let is how you define local variables in a lisp. It is a function that takes two arguments, the first is a list of two element lists and the second is the code where the variables are available. And the first is a list of lists, where the inner list has two elements the variable name and then the expression or value to assign to the value.</p>
      <p>They are weird in the start, but you learn to love them when you start to write a lot of lisps.</p>
      <p>Now, if you are used to Clojure, then a assignment in a let expression can reference variables defined earlier in the same let expression. This is not possible in let in emacs, but it is in let*.</p>

      <p>I have used vim or editors like BBEdit, TextMate or SublimeText (and recently vscode) for most of my carrer. All of them either is a text based editor (vim) or has a command that you can use to open stuff in a GUI edtior.</p>
      <p>The advantage to this is that it is fast to open. This is really useful, if you like me do as much as possible on the command line.</p>
      <p>Emacsclient is a command that lets you send a file to a running instance of Emacs. This is really useful because most realy world configurations of Emacs takes some time to start. The only thing you need is to run M-x start-server or enable server-mode, and you can run "emacsclient" instead of emacs.</p>
      <p>In my configs I have aliased emacs and a bunch of other editor command to it. I think it works great.</p>

      <p>Emacs is my go to editor these days, and have been for a couple of years at this point. I don't really imagine going to back to anything else at this point. I started out using Spacemacs with evil, before I finally moved over to Doom and then after a while ended up rolling my own configuration. And then finally I ditched evil and started learning proper emacs keybinding one year into it. My personal configuration is on <a href="https://github.com/hjertnes/emacs.d">Github</a>. It contains some basic information, and I change it a lot. If I see something cool I add it, and if I don't use it I just remove it.</p>
      <p>I have added some pages with information about emacs packages, but my goal is that I add a page about all the packages I use in time. If you want a place to start look at my list of starter <a href="file:///emacs/starters">projects</a>. All the emacs related pages on this wiki start with Emacs:. And all of them should also be tagged with Emacs and be in this <a href="file:///tags/emacs">list</a> or if you just want the <a href="file:///tags/emacspackage">packages</a></p>

I recommend picking one of the last four if you're just starting out, use doom or spacemacs if you want vim like keybindings or prelude or purcell's emacs.d if you want default ones. Other than that the four are similar. I think my personal setup is a great place to start if you want to build something from scratch.</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>When you use something like (use-package foobar :ensure t) it only works if the package you want to load and the name of it on the melpa or what ever is the same. And while that is the case most of the time, it isn't always. Or somethimes you just want to install something before everything else.</p>
      <p>I have three packages in my emacs configuration that is installed outside use-package for various reasons. There are some ways to get around it, either by nesting things. All of them are messy, and all of them sucks.</p>
      <p>You can see both ways in my personal emacs <a href="https://github.com/hjertnes/emacs.d">config</a>. Sometimes I install them in my package manager module using the built in package-install command. And other times I first run a (use-package) to install the package and then I require what I want or need to load inside its :config. I don't have a lot of packages like this but there is a small handful.</p>
      <p>I do the nesting with smartparens, while I install org-plus-contrib, request and use-package in my package-manager module. The reason I do that is for different reasons. Use-package because it have to be there before I use it, request because it makes things simpler and org-plus-contrib because it is the only good way to do it. I could nest it, but I hate it as much.</p>

      <p>A super short getting started with emacs guide.</p>
      <p>If you're just starting out, I strongly recommend to pick a <a href="file:///emacs/starters">starter</a>. Unless you have a good reason for doing so, I recommend using the emacs keybindings. I didn't start there, but I think it is the only way to really get emacs.</p>
      <p>Then I recommend not doing a lot yet, just get to know how to move around and get some work done. After you're more comfortable I recommend learning how to configure emacs, not from scratch but learn how to install packages and configure them from your starter.</p>
      <p>If you are using emacs keybindings I also recommend you to install no-easy-keys. It is the easiest way to get used to emacs keybindings as fast as possible.</p>
      <p>At some point you probably get the urge to roll your own config. I have a really good super minimal starter for that. It is what I have based my config on. Or it was a result of my config. If you look at spacemacs or prelude or any other fancy emacs configuration system it is just packages that are set up in a particular way plus a system to handle their weird config stuff. That's it</p>
      <p>You just need to figure out how to include the right packages to get the same s.</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>Shells in Emacs is a little bit weird for a number of reasons, most of them has to do with that when you're in a shell that shell might capture a some keyboard input you expected emacs to do and the other way arround. The way it usually works is that it is just passed on to emacs if the shell doesn't do something with it.</p>
      <p>If you want to use a regular shell, like zsh or fish, use M-x ansi-term. I don't recommend this. But if you want to this is the best option.</p>
      <p>What I use most of the time, except for with stuff I know doesn't work or work that great there is to use eshell. It is not a shell like zsh or fish, but rather a shell implemented in eshell. It is well integrated into emacs and most stuff works like you exepect them to.</p>
      <p>This is how I shell in emacs:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>I don't use it as my shell; but rather when I just need to run a few commands.</li>
      <li>Most of the time i use eshell, I also have a command defined from <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EshellMultipleEshellBuffers">here</a> called eshell-new to make it easy to create new eshells, because eshell just send you to the first one if it exist.</li>

      <p>Learning emacs will be a life long project, or at least for as long as you continue to use it. Before we continue, if you want to do anything with emacs other than how it comes out of the box will require you to write some Emacs lisp. And while emacs is great out of the box, the true power comes from making it the best possible for you and your needs.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Read <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/">this</a>. It is a gentle introduction.</li>
      <li>After that I recommend reading the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html">introduction to emacs lisp</a>.</li>
      <li>When you have all of that I recommend that you find a good emacs cheet sheet like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/index.html">this</a>, and start using it. Google is your friend. Install a million packages and learn why it's not a great idea.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you are more familiar with emacs I strongly recommend that you read <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/">Mastering emacs</a>, I have read it many times and it is awesome for learning emacs but also understanding it. I first read it in the hostpital after removing my appendix.</p>
      <p>And every serious emacs user or addict or whatever we are calling ourselves will read the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html">Manual</a> at some point. You can also get a meat space <a href="https://shop.fsf.org/books/gnu-emacs-manual-18th-edition-v-261">version</a>.</p>
      <p>I'm going to get one of them, but there are a few books from there I want to get (the emacs manual, the elisp manual and Stallman's books) but when I go there to check at least one of them have been out of stock.</p>

      <p>Emacs has two kinds of modes major and minor.</p>
      <p>A major mode is like c-mode, org-mode or text-mode. It can probably me something other than text editing. But in general a major mode is what you use to edit a a file of a given format. For example python-mode is a mode you can use to edit python files, and it has functionality that makes that easier and better. You can only have one major mode active at a time.</p>
      <p>A minor mode on the other hand add some kind of functionality. Company is a minor mode, yasnippet is a minormode, projectile is a minor mode. You can have as many minor modes active as you want.</p>

      <p>In emacs you have two kinds of functions, you have a function, it can be called from other functions and you have a interactive function. A interactive functions can be called from other functions and from M-x. A regular function looks something like this (defun hello-world() "Hello World" (message "Hello World!)) where the form is the name followed by a list of arguments (in this case a empty list) a documentation string and the body of the function.</p>
      <p>A interactive function looks almost the same. (defun hello-world() "Hello World" (interactive)(message "Hello World!)). The only difference is the call to interactive between the doc string and the body.</p>
      <p>On the surface interactive enables you to call functions from M-x. But that is kind of just the surface of what it can do. You can also give it a string argument with all kinds of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Interactive-Codes.html#Interactive-Codes">codes</a> ([<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Interactive-Examples.html#Interactive-Examples">https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Interactive-Examples.html#Interactive-Examples</a>][examples]), that examples you do also capture input before invoking the function.</p>

      <p>A lot of emacs users have an urge to use emacs for almost anything. And I'm one of them. If I'm going to type more than a little, I want it to be inside Emacs because I'm really good at manage it and everything inside it. It have slowly been adjusted to work as close to how I want it to be as possible.</p>
      <p>This is my strategy for making it possible:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Almost everything in my life is folders and files, most of them managed by Git repos.</li>
      <li>If I'm going to type I do it in emacs</li>
      <li>If something like running unit tests or debugging or showing code coverage is easier or better in a IDE I write the code in Emacs and do the other stuff in the IDE</li>
      <li>When I see something, and I know it isn't compatible with emacs I always think long and hard about if it is worth it (both sides of it), and usually end up using a less fancy version that works with emacs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To do everyhting in Emacs is in a lot of cases worse, but it makes my life a lot saner to do it this way.</p>

      <h2>Understanding it</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>This is intended as a short introduction into some of the core concepts of emacs. If you want a deeper dive I recommend <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/">Mastering Emacs</a>, it's a great book I've read many times.</p>
      <p>A lot of terminology in emacs is a little bit weird, and crash with what the rest of the world calls it. The reason for this is that Emacs started in the 70s before this terminology existed.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Frame: what everyone else calls a window</li>
      <li>Window: a frame is divded into one or more windows.</li>
      <li>Buffer: everything that is visible in emacs is a buffer, it can be a file or something interactive like a Git app or just some text that isn't saved yet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The emacs window layout is very confusing in the beginning, this is because lisp functions you call may change it. In most other editors it is something a little bit more fixed. This is very powerful because a command can set up the layout to be taylored to something you're going to do and then close it when you're done. This is for it is when you open magit, commit some stuff and then you quit it.</p>
      <p>Another thing you should understand about emacs is that buffers and windows are not one to one. Let's say you are working on a big C# class. For example with some properties on the top, a bunch of contructors in the middle and some private validation methods on the bottom. This is by the way not how I would write it. I would make the properties as a class, then a builder class instead of the constructors and then a seperate validation class. What you could do in emacs, and I do it a lot, is to show the same buffer in multiple windows. To avoid having to jump up and down all the time.</p>

      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell">exec-path-from-shell</a> makes sure emacs inherits path from your shell.</li>
      <li>(when (eq system-type 'darwin) (setq mac-right-option-modifier 'none mac-right-command-modifier 'none)) this makes sure that the right option and command keys on your keyboard isn't handled by Emacs.

      <li>I use <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus">emacs-plus</a> with all the options enabled, becuase i prefer that, the regular emacs cask is the recommended method. I don't do that because I prefer having mailtuils being a part of emacs because of mu4e.</li>

      <p>Emacs configurations can be really strange, and unlike a lot of other config files they can contain hundreds if not thousands of lines of comments and code.</p>
      <p>Org have something called org-babel that let you extract code from org documents. This enable you to write your config as a org document.</p>
      <p>The reason you might want to do this is because it enables you to focus more on commenting and writing how and why for everything in your configuration.</p>

      <p>Anyone who has used emacs seriously must aknowledge its imense power. The place most users see this is in the M-x command. Everything you do in emacs is a lisp function, and some of these functions are so called "interactive" functions. This means that they can be invoked from M-x.</p>
      <p>If something is a keyboard shortcut, it will amost always also be available from M-x. When I don't remember how to do something or don't know how to do something I start searching M-x.</p>
      <p>This is where you see the immense power of Emacs. And when you understand that you could in a few seconds write a lisp function, and evaulate it and have it avilable in M-x you see the insane flexibility of it.</p>

      <p>I started to use elfeed as an experiment, because I was very much not sure about it. But I'm going to continue with it because I really like how easy it is to manage everything. And it have gotten me out of the "can't miss a post" phase. me a double. And I usually give 5 or 6 pages to the daily log collection at a time.</p>
      <p>This system is a lot more work than something like OmniFocus would be. But the work gives me a lot of natural opertunities to review things and it is easy to experiment and figure out what stuff works and does not. And my favourite thing about it is that it works for me.</p>
      <p>And I get to use a lot of notebooks and pens all the time.</p>

      <h2>Why Emacs is a great file manager</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>Emacs has a built in file manager called Dired. It is awesome, and can be extended like everything else in Emacs. And it has Tramp.</p>
      <p>Tramp is a system where you can work with file systems for example as root, over ssh or inside docker containers.</p>

      <h2>Emacs memory usage</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>Emacs has a garbadge collector. The way it works is that every time some threshold is crossed it tries to free up memory. The higher this number is the less often it runs, and the more stuff it has to check per time.</p>
      <p>Over the time I have used emacs I have tried both default, low, high and very high. And I currently keep mine at 25% of my total system memory. And when I see it reching that point I restart it.</p>
      <p>My recommendation however is not a direct reflection of my own setup. I would start with the default settings. This results in slower startup and that things take more time when you install a lot of packages etc. But my experience is that the GC process will bother you less.</p>
      <p>But if you see that you hit the threshold much faster than you'd like to restart emacs. I'd increase it.</p>
      <p>For me it is not a problem to give emacs 2GB and just restart when I reach that once a week or so.</p>

      <h2>How does one even start with Emacs?</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>This is a question I have wondered a lot about recently.</p>
      <p>One way is to start with Spacemacs or Prelude or some of the other starter packs or systems. The other is to just start with a more or less empty init.el and build from there.</p>
      <p>There are good things about either strategy. If you go with the former you probably have everything you need working within an hour. The bad thing about it is that everything looks more complicated than it is and you learn way less.</p>
      <p>I started with Spacemacs and slowly ended up with my custom init.el file that I am way happier with than I ever were with Spacemacs, Doom or any other system.</p>
      <p>I recommend just starting with a init.el file where the basic package management and use package have been set up and start from there. If yo have the time. But if this seems like a stopper and something that will keep you from going for it I recommend going for a starter project.</p>

      <p>Ace-window is a emacs package that makes it easy to jump between "windows" in Emacs, just like ace-jump is a emacs package that makes it easy to jump in a document.</p>
      <p>These are all the default commands and keybindings, the way it works is that you press M-o, then a number will be shown in each "window", if you press it focus will be moved to it. And if you for example press x before the number it will instead delete that window.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>x - delete window</li>
      <li>m - swap windows</li>
      <li>M - move window</li>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>Projectile is a emacs package for juggling multiple projects in emacs. Think of a project as a git repository. You configure it to search for new project in a path; on my systems it is in ~/Code, and then you give it a shortcut; mine i M-p. Then you can for example git M-p p to switch project or M-p SPC to search for a file in the current project. Projectile can do a lot of other stuff as well, and there are many different other stuff that integrate into it.</p>

      <p>If you know what Helm is, you also know what Ivy is: it is more or less the same thing. Except that helm is much more complete, while ivy is smaller and faster. Ivy is a incremental completion library. If you type C-x C-f to open a file or M-x to run a command in stock emacs you get some tab completion but that's it, or if you type C-x C-b you just get a list of buffers and that's it.</p>
      <p>When you set up something like Ivy you can get a much nicer version of them. When I type C-x C-f I get a list of all the files and folders in the current directory and a box to type it in. If I type M-x I first get a list of the most recent commands I have used, and auto completion as I type stuff. And if I type C-x C-b I can search in all the open and recent buffers.</p>
      <p>Note, the part of Ivy I'm talking about here is actually called Counsel.</p>

      <p>I'm not using this at the moment, but I have used it a lot in the past. Deft is a emacs package that adds functionality that is more or less like nvAlt. For those who don't know what that is:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>An app that use a folder of text files as their database</li>
      <li>One note per file</li>
      <li>You have a search field, list of notes and a content area</li>
      <li>As you type into the search area the list of notes are filtered</li>
      <li>When you hit enter you either open the selected note or create a new one with the current search as filename if none matches exist.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most of my notes these days are larger org files instead of a lot of tiny text files. But if this is your thing I recommend checking it out. But you should also look at the <a href="https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/">website</a> because there are a lot of information about how to configure it there.</p>

      <h3>treemacs</h3>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>Treemacs is a emacs package that adds this interesting file browser view on the left of your emacs frame. Kind of like how you get with neotree or what you have in Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text or most other editors.</p>
      <p>I was never a fan of Neotree for a number of reasons. Mainly because when I use emacs I jump between MANY different projects all the time because emacs is made for managing a ton of different shit without having to create new instance. Unlike most other editors. Especially if you use projectile. And Neotree never had any way of keeping up to date with what ever project was active in the active buffer. And the only way I found to solve it was to kill and start it again. That got old fast when you switch projects hundreds of times a day.</p>
      <p>The way treemacs works on the other hand is that you have a similar project explorer on the left. But instead of just being one folder you can add projects to it, so if you can you manage it how ever you like it. It works great, if this is your kind of thing.</p>
      <p>I usually don't use it. But sometimes I do. And when I do I love it. Because it is just this thing on the left that keeps up with what ever project the currently active file is a part of. The one thing I don't like about it is that the default configuration is rather big.</p>

      <h3>smartparens</h3>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>Smartparens is this crazy emacs package that helps you deal with parens pairs. In programming you have various "stuff" you put arround expressions, in lisps they are mostly (), but also "", '' etc. And in other languages you also have {}, [] etc. Smartparens adds these intelligent commands to work with them. You can move, wrap, unwrap, delete etc. It even has a strict mode that tries to keep you from ending up with code that is unbalanced (more closing or opening than the other)</p>
      <p>I can't really git it justice here, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens">website</a>.</p>
      <p>This isn't that straightforward to install with use-package, so check out my emacs <a href="https://github.com/hjertnes/emacs.d">config</a> for details. The TLDR is that I install it outside use-package together with use-package and request and then I load it with use-package later.</p>

      <p>Neotree a emacs package I'm not a huge fan of. It is fine, but I never liked it a lot. It is basically a port of a vim plugin called Nerdtree. If you're looking for a simple show a directly structure file explorer I guess it is fine. But I would recommend looking into <a href="file:///emacs/treemacs">treemacs</a>instead, because it is a LOT better.</p>

      <p>Ace jump mode is this weird mode everyone should learn. Mine is set up to trigger on C-c SPC. So the basic idea is that you hit the keyboard command and a character. Then each place that character is you see a character starting from a. Then you hit the character representing where you want to go and wolla. You're there.</p>
      <p>It is very simple, and awesome. Also: it seems like most people have it installed.</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>I used to have my own snippet system implemented as a series of emacs interactive functions. And then I thought about it and started to replace it with something a little bit less hacky. I ended up with yasnippet. It is great, but it has some things I don't like about it.</p>
      <p>One of them is that there is no way for me to define a snippet that will be available anywhere. Anyways.</p>
      <p>You install the yasnippet package, configure where it should look for snippets and you should also set up some keybindings. There are many different kinds of way to expand them, I use two either I use yas-insert-snippet that give me a dropdown to select from or I use the yas-expand that expands what you just wrote. I have also mapped the yas-next/prev-field commands to be able to use the $1 $2 $3 etc variables. You can basically define places you want input.</p>
      <p>The snippets work like this: you make a folder inside the locaiton for your snip for each mode, and then you add a file for each snippet inside them. There is a lot of information about all of this on the yasnippet website. But you can kind of fix this by adding a .yas-parents file; read more about it <a href="http://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/snippet-organization.html#org7468fa9">here</a>.</p>

      <p>So, I love this package: no-easy-keys. It is the package that really got me into learning the emacs way of life. The short version is that there are keybindings in emacs that make it work as much as you expect it would from other programs like arrow keys etc. And then you have the emacs way of life. Like like C-b for moving backwards or C-f for forward.</p>
      <p>It sounds weird, but it is a lot better once you get used to it.</p>
      <p>So there is this package called no-easy-keys that just disable them. It was really useful for me to get all the emacs stuff into my fingers when I started out learning emacs keybindings.</p>
      <p>I strongly recommend it if you're starting out learning.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>identifiers gives different identifiers like variables, functions or operators different colors so you can easier to distinguish between them and see where something is used.</li>
      <li>delimiters on the other hands makes sure that deliminers like (), [], {} have different colors. This can be very useful in a number of sitations, especially in lips where you often see a lot of them. And it makes it possible with a glance to identify where an expression starts and ends.</li>

      <p>Company is a mode that give you dropdowns that complete works or code as you write. It is very configurable, and can be extended. It has a backend arcitecture that makes it easy to add support for more or less anything. It comes with a few out of the box and other emacs packages or lisp files are free to provider their own.</p>

      <p>It is a great way to show errors as you work, to catch them early instead of ending up like in some projects I have seen out in the wild with 100 000+ warnings that nobody tries to fix.</p>

      <p>There is this awesome emacs package called exec-path-from-shell, it solves some issues you see a lot of on OS X, but I have also seen some of them on Linux in some situations. What it does is that it tries to extract enviornment variables from your default shell and use them in Emacs.</p>
      <p>This matters because let's say some emacs mode expect the command foobar to be available, but you have installed in a weird location, and added it to your path in your shell of choice. This packages solves that.</p>

      <p>All of my sites are powered by it, and I think it is awesome.</p>
      <p>The reason I love it is that it takes care of one thing I always thought was a realy pain in the ass with all the static site systems, and that was to name the file in the right way.

      <p>Undo in emacs are just this ring or long list of changes per buffer. It can be a little bit confusing to understand because a lot of really minor details. The short version is that every time you remove something it is added to the kill ring, and that data can at any point within its configurable limits be brought back.</p>
      <p>While I understand how it works, I have never gotten used to it. So I use undo-tree instead. Instead of it just being this list or ringe of changes it breaks it down into a tree. And it even have this visualization thing you run go into, where you can move along the changes and see the buffer update in real time. And let's say you have a buffer with 10 changes, and you go back two changes, and then start to change that, it will branch out from the main one.</p>
      <p>You may be fine with the regular kill ring implementation, but undo-tree works a hell of a lot better for me.</p>

      <h2>Analog photography tricks for everyone</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>Getting a manual 35mm film camera have been the thing I have learnt the most about photography from.</p>
      <p>Having to adjust all the parameters manually have thought me how to work efficiently with them on all cameras.</p>
      <p>You need to adjust shutter speed, f-stop and focus; and pick a ISO speed and stick to it for the entire film. Sometimes you use a film that is unusable for the situation and you need to change it. And that means wasting money.</p>
      <p>What I do a lot of the time shooting analog is that I set the shutter speed to 1/50th of a second, the slowest I can shoot handheld without having to think aobut it and then I just adjust f-spot. To make zooming easy I also a lot of them time always go for the biggest f-stop possible, unless I'm for some reason really want a shallow depth of field. Back in my street shooting days I used to just pre-set everything and wait until some subject walked into the distanced I had zoomed for.</p>
      <p>Oh yeah, and if you can shoot in f8 almost everything is in focus.</p>
      <p>I placed a Contigo mug with the Autoseal system, because it was really hard to clean and the system broke down after about a year.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>I Shoot in burst</li>
      <li>When I have a few SD cards filled up I import them.</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
      <li>I make a folder with todays date</li>
      <li>I rename the folder to DCIM1, DCIM2 etc before I copy it to the folder I created in step 1.</li>
      <li>When I have copied all of them to my Mac, I run a script that moves all te jpg files to a JPEG folder and all the raw files to a RAW folder.</li>
      <li>Then I copy it to my archive drive</li>
      <li>After that I import the JPEG's into Photos.</li>
      <li>Then I process them, usually delete 90% of the photos.</li>
      <li>Export the once I kept to a folder called "Exported on DATE"</li>
      <li>The Flickr uploadr will pick it up and upload it to Flickr</li>
      <li>When all of that is done I delete te folder from my Mac and review the stuff uploaded to Flickr. Then I make all the stuff I want to be public public. The rest are left private for now.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Most of the time I have the 23mm on my X-Pro, if I'm going somewhere with it I usually also bring the 50mm; sometimes I bring the two other lenses but usually not. I usually bring all my batteries, and I have this SD card case that makes it easy to bring all my SD cards.</p>
      <p>After years of being unhappy with the time I took and what I got out of it I have stopped my Lightroom based workflow I started shooting JPEG + RAW, add the jpegs to Apple Photos and process them, and I just stick the RAW's on an external drive. I shoot with the Acros preset on my camera.</p>
      <p>I'm usually more happy with those results than I ever was with Lightroom.</p>

      <h2>Camera lens focal lengths</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>These are some notes about my views on lens focal lengths. They are in 35mm, if you have a crop sensor like a Fuji or Nikon or Sony you need to divide it by 1.6 or multiply it to go the other way; or 1.5 for Canon. For example a 35mm on 35mm film is 23mm on a Fuji.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Fisheye: a fisheye should have 180 degrees of view, it is the widest you can go and keep a square image. I have one true 180 degrees one that is a 12mm.</li>
      <li>35mm: I think this focal length is the perfect when you just want to walk around shooting snapshots</li>
      <li>50mm: Great if you want a little bit more control of what's in the image than a 35; also great if you want soemthing that's good for both portraits and snapshots.</li>
      <li>70-90mm: The perfect for portraits.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I prefer primes, because they are much easier to shoot with one handed; and I prefer the smallest lens possible over the lowest f-number possible</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>It used to be my main bag for a long time. From I got my 2016 MacBook Escape until early 2019.</p>
      <p>It is a great bag, that worked really well for the kind of stuff I wanted to carry. I can stuff more into that bag because of the great design than I can get into much larger bags. It is just very dense.</p>
      <p>The Synik 22 are much larger, but I can almost fix the same amount of stuff into the Pilot.</p>

      <p>This is my current bag. But it is in for repairs at the moment.</p>
      <p>But it has room for more stuff than the Pilot. I can stuff way more stuff than I should drag back and forth to work into it.</p>
      <p>It is a clamshell bag so it is really easy to deal with.</p>

      <p>I like it a lot. But I alost never need it. Usually when I travel I'll not bring all of the other stuff with me so I bring the Nova and some other bag instead.</p>
      <p>But when I need to bring a bunch of stuff and camera gear on a trip it is great.</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>I got a snout bag when I got my first DSLR. It was kind of like a big lens cap. It works okay with small and medium size lenses. But beyond a certain size it simply put won't fit.</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>The next bag I got was from Lowpro. Yo have probably seen it, it kind of looks like a tall box. I hated it. I think it was similar to the HP 150</p>
      <p>Because it was too big for most cases, but too small to fit a lot of stuff. And it was too tall, so most of the time only the bottom half of the bag was in use.</p>

      <p>I got a large Fjellreven Foldstack messenger bag a while back. I did not work out.</p>
      <p>I replaced it with a Tom Bihn Synik within a year.</p>
      <p>It was okay bag, but it didn't work out for me becase the whole layout of the bag isn't that great for the kind of stuff I carry.</p>
      <p>Seriously. My Tom Bihn Pilot, who can fit inside the Foldstack with some room to spare can fit more of the stuff I want to carry on day to day than te Foldstack.</p>
      <p>This is all because of much better layout, a lot of smaller but not too small compartments instead of a few large.</p>

      <h2>Window Management on OSX</h2>
      <p>Updated 2020-04-20 16:04:68 I think Window Management on OS X are very much optimized for how most people use a computer, either full screen or piled on top of each other. The default window sized are mostly good for people who don't care that much. And if you take into consideration that most people have a 13" MacBook of some sort and the kind of resoution it has from factory I think it is fine.</p>
      <p>But that is not me. Or that is how I do it when I use the built in screen.</p>
      <p>I use moom, I have tried counless alternatives but moom works the best for me. You can do a lot with Moom. My use of it is very simple, I use the five default size optionsm, and I have added four more (resizing it to 1/4 of the screen).</p>
      <p>If I use my MacBook as a laptop I either use the entire screen of a space or I run it in fullscreen mode. And if I'm using my 27" 4K screen I resize most apps most of the time to use 1/4 of the screen. sometimes I use Goland in fullscreen, but that is rare.</p>
      <p>Moom makes this resize process really fast, I just hover click click on each window and the whole process is over in seconds per space.</p>

      <p>for f in $(find . -iname '*.HEIC'); do convert $f $(sed "s/HEIC/JPG/g" &lt;&lt;&lt; "$f"); done</p>
      <p>Just rename HEIC to what ever you are converting from and JPG to what ever you are converting to. The only thing you need to have installed is image magick.</p>

      <h2>OSX and scheduling</h2>
      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>Some stuff have gotten harder and harder to do on OSX in more recent versions of OS X. One of them is using cron to schedule tasks. For those who don't know, cron is a standard way on all UNIX systems to run a command at a given interval defined my a standard way.</p>
      <p>There are different versions, and the differences between doesn't matter a lot. But what makes cron great is that if you go to a unix system you could rely on it being there and you could just copy over your scripts and config and call it a day. It is for example the heart of my git based dropbox replacement.</p>
      <p>Today I gave up on using cron on OS X. Instead I found a great app for defining launchd daemons(because Apple's formats are no near as elegant as a crontab is) called <a href="https://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/">Lingon</a>. It was 15 bucks, but it took me less than a minute to get what I wanted.</p>

      <p>I got a pair of Audio-technica m50x about a year ago. And they are awesome. Very comfortable. But I get a little bit sweaty when I use them for hours after hours after hours. But that isn't really somethin that could be solved without getting open backed ones.</p>
      <p>I have that on my wish list, but not really sure when I'm going to pull the trigger on that.</p>
      <p>But I really like them, and the only way I'd get much better comfort and quality would be if I went for some expensive headphones and amplifier togeter with a TIDAL or something. If the dogs ate them today, I'd order another pair.</p>

      <p>I ordered a Trove Wallet in 2016. I think I got it right before easter. And I just love it. It is a really simple wallet or card holder with three compartments. A large in the middle and two smaller on each side.</p>
      <p>What makes it great however is that it is made out of an elastic material. This means that if you downscale the cards don't just fall out.</p>
      <p>The one I have is still awesome, and I have no plans of getting rid of it. But it is showing some signs of wear.</p>
      <p>They have made a newer model since I got mine, and I'll maybe look into that when I the one I have fall apart. ime it made sense to have seperate web sites. But at this point it is just a bunch of extra work for me. And I have just continued writing a bunch of stuff for like a year even though I would have made more sense to combine the sites.</p>
      <p>This means that I am going to write less about stationary stuff. But I'm still going to write some about it. And my overall goal is to continue writing 3 posts a week as I did when I had two different sites.</p>

      <p>Updated: 2020-03-08 13:03:85</p>
      <p>I have used a bluetooth DAC from AFiio called Btr3 for over six months now. The reason I got it was because the experience of using a lightning to jack dongle while having my iPhone in a pocket was a miserable nightmare of disconnections all the time.</p>
      <p>And I did not want a pair with bluetooth built in because the options are limited and expensive. Also because if the bluetooth break, you have to replace the whole thing.</p>
      <p>The total price is about the same as the flagship headphones from Sony or Bose. But I think you can get much better headphones. And you can replace the bluetooth unit or the headphone unit independently.</p>
      <p>The experience is a little bit worse. But I think the whole package is better.</p>

      <p>I recently got back into Flickr, or Jack tempted me.</p>
      <p>Instead of sharing photos on Micro.blog I upload them to flickr. For a while I shared them as album on my blog. But now I don't do that anymore. I treat Flickr more as a isolated "network". Those who want to see them follow me on Flickr the rest won't see it.</p>
      <p>My workflow is simple, when I have processed them in Photos I export them to a new folder named like "Exported on 2020-01-01", and the flickr uploader picks it up and uploads it all to a Album with the name of the folder. With the status of Private. Then later I look over it and make it public or some other sharing setting I seem appropriate.</p>
      <p>I like it a lot. It feels a little bit like Instagram in a good way, but still works like a grown up photo sharing service.</p>

      <p>Robert Carro is probably my favourite biopgrahers. But his work is more about power than being about the person.</p>
      <p>The big problem with all of his books until recently was that they would be a huge undertaking, and most people would never get into it. It for instance took me years to start listening to his books on Robert Moses even though it was downloaded on my phone.</p>
      <p>So, he recently published a Audible book thing called On Power, that I think is a really good place to start, and now he has published a book about how he works called Working, that is a really good next step.</p>

      <p>24 Bottle came out with a sportslid not too long ago. And I finally got around to ordering one.</p>
      <p>It is plastic, but the quality is great and it works fantastic. With two minor comments there someimes are some condensation on it after a while and sometimes you need to bump it to get the water flowing out. Probably because of vaccum or something.</p>
      <p>The regular lid is way better, but the sports lid is way more useful.</p>

      <p>I'm a huge fan of 24H, we have two their bottles. And I'm probably buy one of their coffee cups soon.</p>
      <p>They are awesome, my bottle have been dropped in the street outside my house three times, each of them would have broken the previous bottles I have used.</p>
      <p>There are two caps available for the 24H. A regular all metal twist cap. It is awesome. No leaking, ever. No condensation. Built like a tank and it does not look like anything could break it.</p>
      <p>And then they have a sports lid. It is made out of plastic. Instead of having to untwist it, you can flip up a straw and drink from it.</p>
      <p>I have used both. One of the time I dropped my bottle, it was with the sportslid and it split in two. But up until that it was great.</p>
      <p>It is way moe convenient, but it isn't as good as the regular one. There is some condensation on it, and it broke.</p>

      <p>If you run OS X, and you for some reason struggle with opening files in some of the folders in your home folder, it is because of some dumb ass OS X security crap. The short reason is that Ruby is involved somehwere in launching Emacs.app, so you need to whitelist /usr/bin/ruby in Full Disk Access. Makes a lot of sense? Not for me either, but it works.</p>
      <p>If you don't figure out how to do this:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Open a terminal</li>
      <li>cd /usr/bin</li>
      <li>open .</li>
