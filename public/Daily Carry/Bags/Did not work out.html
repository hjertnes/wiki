<h1>Snout bag (did not work out)</h1>
<p>I got a snout bag when I got my first DSLR. It was kind of like a big
lens cap. It works okay with small and medium size lenses. But beyond a
certain size it simply put won't fit. I used it for a while, but I
never liked it and it never felt useful.</p>
<h1>My second photo bag (did not work out)</h1>
<p>The next bag I got was from Lowpro. Yo have probably seen it, it kind of
looks like a tall box. I hated it. I think it was similar to the HP 150
Because it was too big for most cases, but too small to fit a lot of
stuff. And it was too tall, so most of the time only the bottom half of
the bag was in use.</p>
<h1>Fjellreven Foldstack no 2</h1>
<p>I got a large Fjellreven Foldstack messenger bag a while back. I did not
work out. I replaced it with a Tom Bihn Synik within a year. It was okay
bag, but it didn't work out for me becase the whole layout of the bag
isn't that great for the kind of stuff I carry. Seriously. My Tom Bihn
Pilot, who can fit inside the Foldstack with some room to spare can fit
more of the stuff I want to carry on day to day than te Foldstack. This
is all because of much better layout, a lot of smaller but not too small
compartments instead of a few large.</p>
