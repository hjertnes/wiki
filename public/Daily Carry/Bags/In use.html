<h1>Tom Bihn Pilot</h1>
<ul>
<li>It used to be my main bag for a long time. From I got my 2016
MacBook Escape until early 2019.</li>
<li>It is a great bag, that worked really well for the kind of stuff I
wanted to carry. I can stuff more into that bag because of the great
design than I can get into much larger bags. It is just very dense.</li>
<li>The Synik 22 are much larger, but I can almost fix the same amount
of stuff into the Pilot.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Tom Bihn Synik 22</h1>
<ul>
<li>This is my current bag. But it is in for repairs at the moment.</li>
<li>But it has room for more stuff than the Pilot. I can stuff way more
stuff than I should drag back and forth to work into it.</li>
<li>It is a clamshell bag so it is really easy to deal with.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Fjellreven Foldstack no 3</h1>
<ul>
<li>I got this bag because I sometimes want to bring some stuff, but not
that much. Like my Kindle, a notebook and a camera. Or something
similar. It is awesome for that, because it is not that big that you
end up bringing a lot of crap.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Photobag Lowpro Nova 170AW 2</h1>
<ul>
<li>It is a small bag, I can fit my X-Pro 2, three lenses plus some
batteries and SD cards.</li>
<li>This is the bag I bring when I just bring my camera and a few extra
things. It is awesome for that.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Big camera backpack: Lowpro BP 250AW 2</h1>
<ul>
<li>This is a big backpack with room for some photo gear on the back of
the bag, making it really hard to steam if off your back.</li>
<li>I like it a lot. But I alost never need it. Usually when I travel
I'll not bring all of the other stuff with me so I bring the Nova
and some other bag instead.</li>
<li>But when I need to bring a bunch of stuff and camera gear on a trip
it is great.</li>
