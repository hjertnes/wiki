<h1 id="tom-bihn-pilot">Tom Bihn Pilot</h1>
<ul>
<li>It used to be my main bag for a long time. From I got my 2016 MacBook Escape until early 2019.</li>
<li>It is a great bag, that worked really well for the kind of stuff I wanted to carry. I can stuff more into that bag because of the great design than I can get into much larger bags. It is just very dense.</li>
<li>The Synik 22 are much larger, but I can almost fix the same amount of stuff into the Pilot.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tom-bihn-synik-22">Tom Bihn Synik 22</h1>
<ul>
<li>This is my current bag. But it is in for repairs at the moment.</li>
<li>But it has room for more stuff than the Pilot. I can stuff way more stuff than I should drag back and forth to work into it.</li>
<li>It is a clamshell bag so it is really easy to deal with.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="fjellreven-foldstack-no-3">Fjellreven Foldstack no 3</h1>
<ul>
<li>I got this bag because I sometimes want to bring some stuff, but not that much. Like my Kindle, a notebook and a camera. Or something similar. It is awesome for that, because it is not that big that you end up bringing a lot of crap.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="photobag-lowpro-nova-170aw-2">Photobag Lowpro Nova 170AW 2</h1>
<ul>
<li>It is a small bag, I can fit my X-Pro 2, three lenses plus some batteries and SD cards.</li>
<li>This is the bag I bring when I just bring my camera and a few extra things. It is awesome for that.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="big-camera-backpack-lowpro-bp-250aw-2">Big camera backpack: Lowpro BP 250AW 2</h1>
<ul>
<li>This is a big backpack with room for some photo gear on the back of the bag, making it really hard to steam if off your back.</li>
<li>I like it a lot. But I alost never need it. Usually when I travel I'll not bring all of the other stuff with me so I bring the Nova and some other bag instead.</li>
<li>But when I need to bring a bunch of stuff and camera gear on a trip it is great.</li>
</ul>
