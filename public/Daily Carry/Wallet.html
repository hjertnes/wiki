<p>I ordered a Trove Wallet in 2016. I think I got it right before easter. And I just love it. It is a really simple wallet or card holder with three compartments. A large in the middle and two smaller on each side.</p>
<p>What makes it great however is that it is made out of an elastic material. This means that if you downscale the cards don't just fall out.</p>
<p>The one I have is still awesome, and I have no plans of getting rid of it. But it is showing some signs of wear.</p>
<p>They have made a newer model since I got mine, and I'll maybe look into that when I the one I have fall apart. ime it made sense to have seperate web sites. But at this point it is just a bunch of extra work for me. And I have just continued writing a bunch of stuff for like a year even though I would have made more sense to combine the sites.</p>
<p>This means that I am going to write less about stationary stuff. But I'm still going to write some about it. And my overall goal is to continue writing 3 posts a week as I did when I had two different sites.</p>
