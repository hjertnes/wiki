<p>24 Bottle came out with a sportslid not too long ago. And I finally got around to ordering one.</p>
<p>It is plastic, but the quality is great and it works fantastic. With two minor comments there someimes are some condensation on it after a while and sometimes you need to bump it to get the water flowing out. Probably because of vaccum or something.</p>
<p>The regular lid is way better, but the sports lid is way more useful.</p>
<p>And I kind of broke mine after a couple of months by dropping it in the street outside my house.</p>
