<p>I'm a huge fan of 24H, we have two their bottles. And I'm probably buy
one of their coffee cups soon.</p>
<p>They are awesome, my bottle have been dropped in the street outside my
house three times, each of them would have broken the previous bottles I
have used.</p>
<p>There are two caps available for the 24H. A regular all metal twist cap.
It is awesome. No leaking, ever. No condensation. Built like a tank and
it does not look like anything could break it.</p>
<p>And then they have a sports lid. It is made out of plastic. Instead of
having to untwist it, you can flip up a straw and drink from it.</p>
<p>I have used both. One of the time I dropped my bottle, it was with the
sportslid and it split in two. But up until that it was great.</p>
<p>It is way moe convenient, but it isn't as good as the regular one.
There is some condensation on it, and it broke.</p>
