<p>I have owne a number of plastic water bottles over the years, including
multiple from contigo.</p>
<p>And while I was happy with them, they were in no way perfect. So in the
end of 2018 I decided to order a tripple walled bottle from 24 Bottles.</p>
<p>I got the &quot;climate&quot; bottle, it has two layers of insulation keep cold
water cold for 24 hours and hot stuff hot for 12. I went with a black
one with the largest capacity available. My only regret is that I did
not get one without paint on it. Becase it isn't the kind of finish
that look cool as it's worn down.</p>
<p>I love this bottle, I can fill it with ice after dinner and still have
some left when I get home from work. This is the kind of bottle I don't
see myself having to replace in a very long time. You could probably
drive a car over it and still use it after.</p>
<p>The default lid is very old school and sturdy, but you have to screw and
unscrew it. It is what I have used since I got mine close to a year ago.
But I have ordered one of the new sport lids that is more like regular
water bottles where you don't have to unscrew it.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend getting one from 24 Bottles.</p>
<p>What I like about it is that unlike the plastic bottles the water never
gets hot. This was a huge issue when I used a plastic bottle in the
office.</p>
