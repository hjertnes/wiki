<li>When you go for close to 100% test coverage you can with confidence say that it does what you think it does. Even with large and complex systems</li>
<li>Most of the issues you see are because of lacking tests beyond coverage, or config stuff.</li>
<li>It is safe to update all packages</li>
<li>I test very little manually</li>
<li>Debuggers aren't a must most of the time.</li>
<li>It is much easier to write clean code when you unit test; and the other way.</li>
<li>If you can't test it, it is probably wrong</li>
<li>It isn't that hard or pain in the ass to get into it if you write clean code</li>
<li>It is way faster in the long run</li>
<li>If you write tests for what you change and cover all of those files it isn't that hard to get a significant coverage. Even in larger code bases.</li>
