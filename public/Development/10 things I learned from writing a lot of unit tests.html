<p>(1).  When you go for close to 100% test coverage you can with confidence
say that it does what you think it does. Even with large and complex
systems
2.  Most of the issues you see are because of lacking tests beyond
coverage, or config stuff.
3.  It is safe to update all packages
4.  I test very little manually
5.  Debuggers aren't a must most of the time.
6.  It is much easier to write clean code when you unit test; and the
other way.
7.  If you can't test it, it is probably wrong
8.  It isn't that hard or pain in the ass to get into it if you write
clean code
9.  It is way faster in the long run
10. If you write tests for what you change and cover all of those files
it isn't that hard to get a significant coverage. Even in larger
code bases.</p>
