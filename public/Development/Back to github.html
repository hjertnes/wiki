<p>I left GitHub because of the whole ICE thingy. And I was off it for like 4-5 months. And I used SourceHut for that period. But I got more and more sick of how the guy behind it behaves. And I went back to GitHub.</p>
<p>Since I left I have also realized that I don't want to get too involved into American politics. Not my fight. And there are some GitHub related tech I need to get better at for my job. Like GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>Another thing is that the github cli is awesome.</p>
