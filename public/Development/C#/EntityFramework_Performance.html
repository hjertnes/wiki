<p>Entity Core is a ORM for .NET Core made by Microsoft. In constrast to
previous versions of it, the Core version of EF is really great. Yeah, I
mean it.</p>
<p>There is two things you need to keep in mind while working with EF</p>
<p>One query going on per &quot;request&quot; at a time; in other words, if you
loop over some rest and then need to do some queries inside that loop,
you need to do a .ToList() or similar before starting the loop.</p>
<p>If you a .ToList, ToArray, First or anything like that it will query the
database, and if you run SaveChanges or SaveChanges async it will write
data to the database. You want to make sure you only query the database
as late as possible and that you save the context as infrequent as
possible. I usually do it once per API request.</p>
