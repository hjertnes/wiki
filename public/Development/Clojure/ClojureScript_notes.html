<p>Just some notes for myself after spending a great deal of time testing
out various things over a few days to see if I can find something in the
same ball park as Create React App with Redux.
Figwheel Main is awesome. But the default settings are weird
Rum and Reagent are interesting. But I have a hard time finding anything
else than re-frame that seems like a complete solution
Reframe is a lot of stuff&quot;&quot; to understand, but it just works, and like
you expect. But I'm not a fan of it because it feels very much like a
framework.
TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is what I should do in order to make ClojureScript work for me</li>
<li>Build something that kind of work like React+Redux based on Clojure
atoms</li>
<li>Build some wrapper arround the router thing to make it less verbose.</li>
<li>And it hsould all be based on Reagent, Figwheel-main etc.</li>
<li>And this <a href="https://github.com/Lokeh/reagent-context">https://github.com/Lokeh/reagent-context</a></li>
