<p>I think Clojure is a great langauge, but too much of it is a mess.</p>
<p>For example. There is not a good system for if a package is regular clojure only or clojurescript only or works with both. And a lot of the time you end up with packages that are a wrapper around for example the native dattime library of either, and not a common sensible abstraction that works on both systems.</p>
<p>Another major problem is how much work it is to figure out how to start a project, install some packages, make something and then build it for production.</p>
<p>Some templates are out dated others are not. Some works others not. And it is far from as easy as with other systems to just make it and use it.</p>
<p>If you compare it to Go, .Net Core or React the three things I have spent the most time on outside Clojure over the last 5 years or so. I have built complex stuff in less time than I managed to do a proper production build of a POC frontend in Clojurescript or a POC rest API with Clojure.</p>
<p>Again. I love the language, and I think it has some great ideas. But for me at this point, it isn't a good fit. Because I'd rather make stuff than to fight tooling and bullshit that should be solved out of te box.</p>
