<p>Some programming languages have access keywords you can use to control
how what are accessed. I've always had the impression that the main
thing about them was security, but that isn't it. There are probably
some cases where it is security aspects to it.
But the main thing is to control what part of your code is visibile to
other parts of it. This is very important in general, but especially
when you write packages.
Clean code and all of that comes it here.
But if you have clear abstractions with think interfaces to your code
and the rest is not visible to others parts of your code base or other
packages importing it then you don't have to think too much about
breaking changes.
If all of your code is public, then everything importing your package
will have access to it. And that means that you will be very limited in
changes you can do without breaking other peoples code. If you instead
only what is absolutley neccessary is exposed you have much more freedom
with all the rest of the code</p>
