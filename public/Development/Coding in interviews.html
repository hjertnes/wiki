<p>I have gone to countless developer interviews at this point. And I have
gotten jobs with zero technical tests and I have done technical tests.
As with everything else in a job interview there are good and bad ways
of doing it.</p>
<p>Everything in a interview will work better if you focus a lot on making
everyone comfortable. Then you get a better view on the candidate, and
the candidate gets a much better impression of the employer.</p>
<p>When you run a technical test, the most important thing is that everyone
understand what the purpose of the test, and what you are looking for.</p>
