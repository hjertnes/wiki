<h1>Making code run faster</h1>

<p>Lets say you have some &quot;code&quot; for example an API endpoint or some user interface that you don't think is fast enough, and you'd like to improve it. Where do you start?</p>
<p>I usually start by getting some numbers on how fast it is. If it is a API endpoint I try to test it more than once, noting response time. I usually re-start the service test it like 3 times and repeat a few times. Makes sure to invalidate caches if there are any outside the running applications.</p>
<p>Then I write down exactly how I tested it, and the slowest, fastest and average.</p>
<p>The next step for me is to first look for something obvious in the affected code. If there aren't anything I start adding logging to see how much time the different things take. And when I have a better understanding of how time I spent it is easy to see if there anything should be done with the code or if external factors are the cause. Like bad a database integration.</p>
