&quot;We didn't call it fuzzing back in the 1950s, but it was our standard
practice to test programs by inputting decks of punch cards taken from
the trash.
We also used decks of random number punch cards. We weren't networked
in those days, so we weren't much worried about security, but our
random/trash decks often turned up undesirable behavior.
Every programmer I knew used the trash-deck technique.&quot;
