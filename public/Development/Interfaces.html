<p>Interfaces are a structure in many programming languages. I think I have
only seen them in statically typed languages. Like C#, Java, Golang,
TypeScript etc.
I used to think they were kind of dumb. But I have grown to love them.
They work differently in different languages. In C#, Java, TypScript
etc the interfaces a class implements are tied to it. While in Goland
they are implicit.
Explicit interfaces are easier to understand, while implicit ones are
much more flexible and really powerful because you can add your own
eithout touch the original code.
Interfaces are useful for a number of things</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit Testing: you can mock the methods of a interface, making it
possible to write code in a way where your unit test only care about
how that class works and you can mock responses and behaviour of
other stuff it uses.</li>
<li>Cleaner depdencies. If you build large micro service system you
often have a bunch of shared code. So you start building some small
packages to avoi duplication. Sooner or later you have a mess of
dependeices between the packages etc. What you can do is to have the
interfaces in one package and the implementations in another. The
interfacaes are usually more stable than implementations (because
bugs). In this way all the packages only need to deal with the
interfaces and the service using them also need to have the
implementations</li>
<li>More flexible code bases. Let's say you have an interface for your
data access layer in your restful API. Then you could change
databases without changing any code outside that module.</li>
