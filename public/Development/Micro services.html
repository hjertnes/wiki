<p>Most companies don't need micro services, because they are designed to solve problems larger companies or projects have. They run slower, are harder to work with and add a different kind of complexity. But if you have more than a few people that work on a lot of different people at once they can make it easier for you to move much faster and design better software.</p>
<p>The alternative to micro services are monoliths. They have a bunch of problems, like taking a long time to build, deploy and causing a lot of merge conflicts. Another issue with a monolith is that it often is much harder to update dependencies because it is a lot of work if this is a service with hundreds if not thousands of endpoints.</p>
<p>I think there are advantages to using a micro service setup even if you only have like 5-10 developers. BUT. Do it because you need to solve some problems you have instead of "Google does it".</p>
