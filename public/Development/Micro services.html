<p>Most companies don't need micro services, because they are designed to
solve problems larger companies or projects have. They run slower, are
harder to work with and add a different kind of complexity. But if you
have more than a few people that work on a lot of different people at
once they can make it easier for you to move much faster and design
better software.</p>
<p>The alternative to micro services are monoliths. They have a bunch of
problems, like taking a long time to build, deploy and causing a lot of
merge conflicts. Another issue with a monolith is that it often is much
harder to update dependencies because it is a lot of work if this is a
service with hundreds if not thousands of endpoints.</p>
<p>I think there are advantages to using a micro service setup even if you
only have like 5-10 developers. BUT. Do it because you need to solve
some problems you have instead of &quot;Google does it&quot;.</p>
