<blockquote>
<p>I use this package every day, and have been doing so for years. It
just works. At least, it works for all my use cases. And if it breaks
somehow, I fix it. &gt; &gt; However, it has become painfully clear to me
that I don't have time to fix problems I don't have. It's been years
since I could keep pace with the issues and pull requests. Whenever I
try, I keep getting feedback that my fix isn't good enough by some
standard I don't particularly care about. &gt; &gt; So, I have closed the
issue tracker and the pull requests. I hope you can happily use this
package, just like I do. If it doesn't work for you, then I'm sorry.
Thankfully Emacs is infinitely malleable, you can probably fix it
yourself. &gt; &gt; TLDR: I am still maintaining this package, but I am no
longer crowdsourcing a list of issues.</p>
