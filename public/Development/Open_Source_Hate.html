<p>This describe a lot of my issues with FOSS development in 2020</p>

<p>&gt; I use this package every day, and have been doing so for years. It just works. At least, it works for all my use cases. And if it breaks somehow, I fix it. &gt; &gt; However, it has become painfully clear to me that I don't have time to fix problems I don't have. It's been years since I could keep pace with the issues and pull requests. Whenever I try, I keep getting feedback that my fix isn't good enough by some standard I don't particularly care about. &gt; &gt; So, I have closed the issue tracker and the pull requests. I hope you can happily use this package, just like I do. If it doesn't work for you, then I'm sorry. Thankfully Emacs is infinitely malleable, you can probably fix it yourself. &gt; &gt; TLDR: I am still maintaining this package, but I am no longer crowdsourcing a list of issues.</p>
