<p>Just read the link above. My personal take is that hooks made things a
lot better. It is much easier to and cleaner to get various resources
than before. And components are in general much smaller after hooks.
Also things like useMemo have made much cleaner ways of doing very
common stuff.</p>
<p>There are of course a lot of complexities, but I'm always more
interested in of something makes it better rather than the perfect.</p>
