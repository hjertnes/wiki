<p>Just read the link above. My personal take is that hooks made things a lot better. It is much easier to and cleaner to get various resources than before. And components are in general much smaller after hooks. Also things like useMemo have made much cleaner ways of doing very common stuff.</p>
<p>There are of course a lot of complexities, but I'm always more interested in of something makes it better rather than the perfect.</p>
