<p>All code are built into something that the machine can run, some are
compiled while others are built when you run it and some are in the
middle. A C or C++ program is compiled while a Python program isn't and
C# and Java are in between.</p>
<p>Some langauges are statically typed while others are dynamic. Most of
the static ones also allow you to code in a dynamic way.</p>
<p>This is about what type safety is. This is not about &quot;security&quot;
safety, while there are some security benefits to it that is not the
main thing.</p>
<p>When you write programs in a static way where you define what types
everything has. Like this is a string and this is a custom type with
these values with these types you can after the program starts that the
basics are correct.</p>
<p>Especially if you use modern features that keep you from passing null to
everything. There are still a lot of bugs to fix. But you get rid of
most null reference and fields not being present in object type
problems.</p>
<p>The main safety it gives you is that a lot of problems can be discovered
without testing the program.</p>
