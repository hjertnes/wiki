<p>All code are built into something that the machine can run, some are
compiled while others are built when you run it and some are in the
middle. A C or C++ program is compiled while a Python program isn't and
C# and Java are in between.
Some langauges are statically typed while others are dynamic. Most of
the static ones also allow you to code in a dynamic way.
This is about what type safety is. This is not about &quot;security&quot;
safety, while there are some security benefits to it that is not the
main thing.
When you write programs in a static way where you define what types
everything has. Like this is a string and this is a custom type with
these values with these types you can after the program starts that the
basics are correct.
Especially if you use modern features that keep you from passing null to
everything. There are still a lot of bugs to fix. But you get rid of
most null reference and fields not being present in object type
problems.
The main safety it gives you is that a lot of problems can be discovered
without testing the program.</p>
