<p>A super short getting started with emacs guide.
If you're just starting out, I strongly recommend to pick a <a href="Starterkits.org">Emacs
Starterkits</a>. Unless you have a good reason for doing
so, I recommend using the emacs keybindings. I didn't start there, but
I think it is the only way to really get emacs.
Then I recommend not doing a lot yet, just get to know how to move
around and get some work done. After you're more comfortable I
recommend learning how to configure emacs, not from scratch but learn
how to install packages and configure them from your starter.
If you are using emacs keybindings I also recommend you to install
no-easy-keys. It is the easiest way to get used to emacs keybindings as
fast as possible.
At some point you probably get the urge to roll your own config. I have
a really good super minimal starter for that. It is what I have based my
config on. Or it was a result of my config. If you look at spacemacs or
prelude or any other fancy emacs configuration system it is just
packages that are set up in a particular way plus a system to handle
their weird config stuff. That's it
You just need to figure out how to include the right packages to get the
same</p>
