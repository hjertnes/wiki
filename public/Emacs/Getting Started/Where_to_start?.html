<p>This is a question I have wondered a lot about recently.</p>
<p>One way is to start with Spacemacs or Prelude or some of the other starter packs or systems. The other is to just start with a more or less empty init.el and build from there.</p>
<p>There are good things about either strategy. If you go with the former you probably have everything you need working within an hour. The bad thing about it is that everything looks more complicated than it is and you learn way less.</p>
<p>I started with Spacemacs and slowly ended up with my custom init.el file that I am way happier with than I ever were with Spacemacs, Doom or any other system.</p>
<p>I recommend just starting with a init.el file where the basic package management and use package have been set up and start from there. If yo have the time. But if this seems like a stopper and something that will keep you from going for it I recommend going for a starter project.</p>
