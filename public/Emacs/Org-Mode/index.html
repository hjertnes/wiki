<p>Org-mode is many things to many people, and is very extentible.</p>
<p>You can do a lot with it, some use it like markdown, while others more
like a task paper like thing or even literate programming.</p>
<p>Markdown is a markup language designed to make it easy to write posts
and stuff like it, with easy to use syntax to do stuff like headings,
links, text formatting etc. Org-mode can do all of this. But it is not 1
= 1. I personally prefer to use org, but I think markdown is a better
option for writing for the web.</p>
<p>There is also this insane universe of using org-mode for task paper,
calendaring and stuff like that. I personally perfer to write task
paper, but I prefer to manage stuff through org-mode.</p>
<p>Another popular thing to use org-mode for is to do literate programming.
The basic idea is that you write a document, and then you insert code
blocks in it. Theese code blocks can either be something that are
exported or you run it there.</p>
<p>This is just a short overview of the stuff I have use org-mode for. It
is a very flexible system that you can do all kinds of crazy stuff with.</p>
