<p>There are many different completion modes for emacs, but I think company
mode is one of the major ones. It did at least seem like the standard
when I started out. I still use it today, because I can't see that any
of the others are any better.</p>
<p>Company is a mode that give you dropdowns that complete works or code as
you write. It is very configurable, and can be extended. It has a
backend arcitecture that makes it easy to add support for more or less
anything. It comes with a few out of the box and other emacs packages or
lisp files are free to provider their own.</p>
<p>I have packages installed that does this for Javascript/node, C# and
Clojure to mention a few.</p>
