<p>I started to use elfeed as an experiment, because I was very much not sure about it. But I'm going to continue with it because I really like how easy it is to manage everything. And it have gotten me out of the "can't miss a post" phase. me a double. And I usually give 5 or 6 pages to the daily log collection at a time.</p>
<p>This system is a lot more work than something like OmniFocus would be. But the work gives me a lot of natural opertunities to review things and it is easy to experiment and figure out what stuff works and does not. And my favourite thing about it is that it works for me.</p>
<p>And I get to use a lot of notebooks and pens all the time.</p>
