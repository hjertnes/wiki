<p>I have written about a lot emacs packages on this wiki. They are not the packages I myself currently use. My setup change almost daily, as I try to adjust things and remove stuff I don't use, re-add it, replacing it with something else etc. But all of the stuff I have mentioned here have at some point been in my config. And they are here as a reference for me and others. As a explaination of what they do etc.</p>
