<p>OX-hugo is a emacs package that lets you write your website as this
large org file or multiple large org files and it exports it all to
markdown files that hugo understands how to work with(or you can wrangle
it to work with more or less anything that use markdwn frontmatter files
like jekyll etc).</p>
<p>All of my sites are powered by it, and I think it is awesome.</p>
<p>The reason I love it is that it takes care of one thing I always thought
was a realy pain in the ass with all the static site systems, and that
was to name the file in the right way. With ox-hugo I just define it as
a property that mostly gets autofilled by yasnippet. I just expand,
write and export followed by a git commit and push.</p>
