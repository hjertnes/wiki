<p>Smartparens is this crazy emacs package that helps you deal with parens
pairs. In programming you have various &quot;stuff&quot; you put arround
expressions, in lisps they are mostly (), but also &quot;&quot;, '' etc. And
in other languages you also have {}, [] etc. Smartparens adds these
intelligent commands to work with them. You can move, wrap, unwrap,
delete etc. It even has a strict mode that tries to keep you from ending
up with code that is unbalanced (more closing or opening than the other)</p>
<p>I can't really git it justice here, check out the
<a href="https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens">website</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't that straightforward to install with use-package, so check
out my emacs <a href="https://github.com/hjertnes/emacs.d">config</a> for details.
The TLDR is that I install it outside use-package together with
use-package and request and then I load it with use-package later.</p>
