<p>A lot of emacs users have an urge to use emacs for almost anything. And
I'm one of them. If I'm going to type more than a little, I want it to
be inside Emacs because I'm really good at manage it and everything
inside it. It have slowly been adjusted to work as close to how I want
it to be as possible.
This is my strategy for making it possible:
Almost everything in my life is folders and files, most of them managed
by Git repos.
If I'm going to type I do it in emacs
If something like running unit tests or debugging or showing code
coverage is easier or better in a IDE I write the code in Emacs and do
the other stuff in the IDE
When I see something, and I know it isn't compatible with emacs I
always think long and hard about if it is worth it (both sides of it),
and usually end up using a less fancy version that works with emacs.
To do everyhting in Emacs is in a lot of cases worse, but it makes my
life a lot saner to do it this way.</p>
