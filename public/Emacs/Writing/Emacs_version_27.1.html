<p>Did a &quot;live blog&quot; as I was reading the
<a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.27">newsfile</a>
yesterday. In my <a href="https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt">twtxt</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a more blog posty version, and a little bit longer version of
that. Aka a summary of some of the stuff I saw in Emacs 27 that I really
look forward to.</p>
<ul>
<li>make-empty-file</li>
<li>There is a new elisp-function called make-empty-file that makes it
really easy to make a empty file. This will be really useful for a
lot of people for a bunch of stuff. For me it will make my emacs
config more resillient. There are two files in my emacs config that
isn't a part of the git repo (because they are local to that
system, and should not be shared) that I today need to manually
create for it to work. (personal.el for overriding config on that
machine, and custom.el)</li>
<li>jsx support</li>
<li>This will make react development and web dev that use a similar HTML
and JavaScript at the same time syntax much better in Emacs.</li>
<li>Tabs!</li>
<li>There is two kinds, one for having multiple window setups, and one
more like regular tabs where it is a bunch of buffers in a tab-bar.</li>
<li>ISO 8601 date parsing</li>
<li>There is a new package making is much easier to parse ISO 8601
stuff.</li>
</ul>
