<p>Did a "live blog" as I was reading the [news file](<a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.27">https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.27</a>) yesterday. In my [twtxt](<a href="https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt">https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt</a>).</p>
<p>Here is a more blog posty version, and a little bit longer version of that. Aka a summary of some of the stuff I saw in Emacs 27 that I really look forward to.</p>

This will be really useful for a lot of people for a bunch of stuff. For me it will make my emacs config more resillient. There are two files in my emacs config that isn't a part of the git repo (because they are local to that system, and should not be shared) that I today need to manually create for it to work. (personal.el for overriding config on that machine, and custom.el)</h2>
