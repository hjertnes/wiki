<p>Anyone who has used emacs seriously must aknowledge its imense power.
The place most users see this is in the M-x command. Everything you do
in emacs is a lisp function, and some of these functions are so called
&quot;interactive&quot; functions. This means that they can be invoked from M-x.</p>
<p>If something is a keyboard shortcut, it will amost always also be
available from M-x. When I don't remember how to do something or don't
know how to do something I start searching M-x.</p>
<p>This is where you see the immense power of Emacs. And when you
understand that you could in a few seconds write a lisp function, and
evaulate it and have it avilable in M-x you see the insane flexibility
of it.</p>
