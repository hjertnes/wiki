<p>I have been a Emacs guy for a very long time at this point. Probalby 3.5 years. I have learnt a lot about it. And I have had a lot of fun. But recently I decided to take a break.</p>
<p>There are many things to it. But the most important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to move away from Emacs keybindings in general and instead use something a little bit more mainstream because Emacs keybindings don't work that well beyond the surface in the IDE's I use.</li>
<li>When you use emacs client to open files in Emacs and never close them you get this annoying message when you try to quit Emacs</li>
<li>When you use Emacs you always end up trying to have everything inside it. And that isn't really how I want to do things in 2021. I have been moving more and more back into the shell.</li>
</ul>
