<p>This is intended as a short introduction into some of the core concepts
of emacs. If you want a deeper dive I recommend <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/">Mastering
Emacs</a>, it's a great book I've read
many times.</p>
<p>A lot of terminology in emacs is a little bit weird, and crash with what
the rest of the world calls it. The reason for this is that Emacs
started in the 70s before this terminology existed. 0 Frame: what
everyone else calls a window</p>
<ul>
<li>Window: a frame is divded into one or more windows.</li>
<li>Buffer: everything that is visible in emacs is a buffer, it can be a
file or something interactive like a Git app or just some text that
isn't saved yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The emacs window layout is very confusing in the beginning, this is
because lisp functions you call may change it. In most other editors it
is something a little bit more fixed. This is very powerful because a
command can set up the layout to be taylored to something you're going
to do and then close it when you're done. This is for it is when you
open magit, commit some stuff and then you quit it.</p>
<p>Another thing you should understand about emacs is that buffers and
windows are not one to one. Let's say you are working on a big C#
class. For example with some properties on the top, a bunch of
contructors in the middle and some private validation methods on the
bottom. This is by the way not how I would write it. I would make the
properties as a class, then a builder class instead of the constructors
and then a seperate validation class. What you could do in emacs, and I
do it a lot, is to show the same buffer in multiple windows. To avoid
having to jump up and down all the time.</p>
