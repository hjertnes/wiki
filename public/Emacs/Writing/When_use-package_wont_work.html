<h1>When use-package won't work</h1>

<p>When you use something like (use-package foobar :ensure t) it only works
if the package you want to load and the name of it on the melpa or what
ever is the same. And while that is the case most of the time, it isn't
always. Or somethimes you just want to install something before
everything else.</p>
<p>I have three packages in my emacs configuration that is installed
outside use-package for various reasons. There are some ways to get
around it, either by nesting things. All of them are messy, and all of
them sucks.</p>
<p>You can see both ways in my personal emacs
<a href="https://github.com/hjertnes/emacs.d">config</a>. Sometimes I install them in my package manager module using the built in package-install command. And other times I first run a (use-package)
to install the package and then I require what I want or need to load
inside its :config. I don't have a lot of packages like this but there
is a small handful.</p>
<p>I do the nesting with smartparens, while I install org-plus-contrib,
request and use-package in my package-manager module. The reason I do
that is for different reasons. Use-package because it have to be there
before I use it, request because it makes things simpler and
org-plus-contrib because it is the only good way to do it. I could nest
it, but I hate it as much.</p>
