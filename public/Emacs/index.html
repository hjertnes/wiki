<p>Emacs is my go to editor these days, and have been for a couple of years at this point. I don't really imagine going to back to anything else at this point. I started out using Spacemacs with evil, before I finally moved over to Doom and then after a while ended up rolling my own configuration. And then finally I ditched evil and started learning proper emacs keybinding one year into it. My personal configuration is on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~hjertnes/emacs.d">Github</a>. It contains some basic information, and I change it a lot. If I see something cool I add it, and if I don't use it I just remove it. I have added some pages with information about emacs packages, but my goal is that I add a page about all the packages I use in time. If you want a place to start look at my list of starters</p>
