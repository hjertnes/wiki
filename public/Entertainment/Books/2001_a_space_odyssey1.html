<p>I'm a huge fan of the movie, I have seen it countless times. And I love it all the way to the end. But the end has always been very weird to me.</p>
<p>Anyways. I recently got the book that was written for the movie. And I thought it was really great. They are very similar, while at the same time different.</p>
<p>I think each of them work really great on their formats. But I think the ending is much less weird in the book.</p>
<p>Also the book has a more singular perspective.</p>
