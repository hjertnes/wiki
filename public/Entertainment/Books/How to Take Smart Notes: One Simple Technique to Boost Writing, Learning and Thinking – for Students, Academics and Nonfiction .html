<p>This book is insane. It was the thing that got me to get into this deep
rabbit hole of Roam, and then org-roam. Where I currently have close to
a 1000 notes and a bunch of links between them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a pen in your hand while writing</li>
<li>If you write while reading you ensure you understand it</li>
<li>Capture all ideas. This is fleeting notes</li>
<li>Literature notes. When you read something write about the content</li>
<li>Filing notes
<ul>
<li>behind one or more relates notes</li>
<li>Links to them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slip box is simple. Like how the Russians used a pencil in space
instead of making a space pen</li>
<li>(Luhmann used the DIN A6 size, 148 x 105 mm or 5.83 x 4.13 inches)</li>
<li>The student is not there for the professor and the professor is not
there for the student</li>
<li>You cant learn indepndence you need to do it</li>
<li>Taking the notes is just half the job</li>
<li>Writing notes in a book is useless, you need to take them in a way
where you can find it easy</li>
<li>Types of notes
<ul>
<li>Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information</li>
<li>Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the
necessary information in themselves in a permanently -
understandable way.</li>
<li>Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular
project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and
discarded</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideally, new notes are written with explicit reference to already
existing notes.</li>
<li>The first type of links are those on notes that are giving you the
overview of a topic.</li>
<li>Taking the notes is only the first part of the job</li>
<li>Positive feedback loop: the experience of doing the thing must be
positive for it to work</li>
<li>Multitasking is a bad idea</li>
<li>Give every task your full attention</li>
</ul>
