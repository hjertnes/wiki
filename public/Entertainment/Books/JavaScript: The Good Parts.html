<p>This book was a really important part of me getting in JavaScript back
in the day. Probably not that relevant over 10 years later. But this was
at a point where building apps in just javascript wasn't that common
yet. I read it as a co-worker of mine (Asbj√∏rn) got me into the idea of
doing it.
Before this I just thought of JavaScript as something you use to extend
something and not what you use to make it.</p>
