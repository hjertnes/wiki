This was a really interesting book about a Norwegian Highschool called &quot;forsøksgym&quot; that started in the late 60s and kept going until early 2000s.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a real 60s and 70s concept. There were no syllabus and nothing was mandatory. It was a real interesting read. Especially how much they had to fight for its exsistance and how much of what they wanted are kind of a part of regular high schools now.</p>
