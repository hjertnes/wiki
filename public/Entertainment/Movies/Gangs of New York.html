<p>I remember watching this movie for the first time the year I was 20.</p>
<p>It is so great. Such a fantastic story.</p>
<p>There are many ways I think it is a great movie. Part is how it starts
out as a fight that the main characters father started, and died during.
And then it is started up again by the son when he is grown up. It is a
interesting look at how conflicts will never go away unless properly
dealth with.</p>
<p>And I also love how there is the his Civil War thing going on that
nobody cares about.</p>
