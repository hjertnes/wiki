<p>I have no idea why I never watched this movie when it first came out.
But I never did. And then I never got around to it until I found it on
Netlix a while back.
It is a really weird movie, and I'm not that into car stuff.
This is the kind of movie that is a perfectly fine way to spend a few
hours one night. But I don't think it was that great or interesting
beyond that.
The female roles in it are great though.</p>
