<p>I really hated it the first time. Bumped it up to "fine" on the re-watch.</p>
<p>I have no idea why, but every single Superman movie I see is the most boring unengaging pile of meh.</p>
<p>I have no idea how many DC movies I have seen at this point. But most of them are really bad. What they seem to not understand is how to turn it into something that is fun. What Marvel did is that they don't took themselves too serious or let the comic books control the movies too much.</p>
