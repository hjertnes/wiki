<p>I really hated it the first time. Bumped it up to &quot;fine&quot; on the
re-watch.
I have no idea why, but every single Superman movie I see is the most
boring unengaging pile of meh.
I have no idea how many DC movies I have seen at this point. But most of
them are really bad. What they seem to not understand is how to turn it
into something that is fun. What Marvel did is that they don't took
themselves too serious or let the comic books control the movies too
much.</p>
