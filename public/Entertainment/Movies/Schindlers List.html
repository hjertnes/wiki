<p>5/5</p>
<p>I hate most WW2 movies, because they are kind of just the same crap over and over and ocer that wasn't that interesting as a movie in the first place.</p>
<p>This one on the other hand is really great. Because it is more about running a factory and running a concentration camp than the war itself.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that the main character use jews from a camp as work labour to supply Germany with industrial goods under WW2. And then when the war ends and they are going to kill all the Jews he makes a list and use all his money to free as many Jews as possible.</p>
