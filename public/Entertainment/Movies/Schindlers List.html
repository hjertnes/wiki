<p>I hate most WW2 movies, because they are kind of just the same crap over
and over and ocer that wasn't that interesting as a movie in the first
place.
This one on the other hand is really great. Because it is more about
running a factory and running a concentration camp than the war itself.
The basic idea is that the main character use jews from a camp as work
labour to supply Germany with industrial goods under WW2. And then when
the war ends and they are going to kill all the Jews he makes a list and
use all his money to free as many Jews as possible.</p>
