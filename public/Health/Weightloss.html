<li>Started by counting calories, and logging it with a goal that adjusted based on how much I moved</li>
<li>Worked for a while. And was great while getting into the habit</li>
<li>Then I changed to a static goal</li>
<li>For the most part it works great.</li>
<li>Now I have started to see myself changing what I eat and focus more on food that makes me feel full longer while at the same time counting fewer calories</li>
<li>Reduced the calorie goal again, to reflect how much I move when I don't walk Ea</li>
<li>Time to start looking into eating better dinners</li>
