<div><ul>
<li><a href="/Lists/index.html">Lists</a></li>
<li>It seems pretty solid in general</li>
<li>Wish it wasn't all bullets always</li>
<li>The web site is rough on mobile</li>
<li>It drives me a little bit nuts that it doesn't autofocus to the
text area of the note when I select a page</li>
<li>I wish there was tags and folders to organize things</li>
<li>I hate the title format for daily notes</li>
<li>Why can't it remember my &quot;hide daily notes&quot; setting?</li>
<li>I'm underwhelmed by the Graph Overview Seems like there is a
shortcut for moving focus to the note text cmd-enter</li>
<li>Turns out there are &quot;tags&quot;, if you link to something that don't
exist it will be created. Kind of works like tags</li>
<li>Still miss being able to organize things</li>
<li>And for the UI to remember settings</li>
<li>The offline stuff works pretty well</li>
<li>The phone interface isn't that bad</li>
<li>Much better than I had expected.</li>
<li>For some reason it doesn't start a line with capital letter</li>
<li>Considering moving my wiki into this</li>
<li>At least some of it</li>
<li>I like how the imported docs are added to daily notes.</li>
<li>Makes it really easy to deal with them after</li>
<li>The import / export stuff isn't that great</li>
<li>And the all notes section is a mess with large amounts of data</li>
<li>Why doesn't roam support uploading files?</li>
</ul>
