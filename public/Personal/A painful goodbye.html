<p>I've posted about this earlier. But my mum had to let our family dog of 11 year go on Tuesday. It was not a huge surprise because of her age. But still very hard, and a lot harder for my mother. And Luna will probably be very sad and confused when she can't find her the next time we visit.</p>
<p>Tom Waits didn't want to grow up, Nemi never dit. It's great to see a dog of 10 years old play like she was 1.</p>
