But one thing that I don't like about the culture is that sometimes people reply to me complaining about my sarcasm, snark etc. I get that all of us should be nice most of the time. There are still a place for snark and other more "rude" or what ever you want to call them forms of communication. And some of us including myself, use this all the time.</h2>

And that is awesome. But as far as I can see the API does not have a lot of great documentation. I have tried to push Manton towards Open API Specifications once. Which I think would be a step in the right direction. But I also think that one should be able to do an app with the same features as the official one (including push notificaitons) with the official API. And it is really ridicolus that a CORS issue with the API have been open for like forever. This issue makes it impossible to make a web app that interacts with the API's without wrapping the API's in your own service.</h2>
