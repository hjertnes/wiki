<p>I have my last day as a developer for Sbanken on Monday, and I'll have
2ish of vacation, before I join Knowit Experience as a Senior Developer
in the start of November.</p>
<p>I'm really excited about this for many reasons. Two of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll be using a Mac at work again. After two years of Windows, I
can say that everything I hated about it in 2004, is still more or
less the same</li>
<li>And I'll be working from the city center. I might start doing some
street photography again.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are of course many much more serious reasons for why I decided to
change jobs and decided to join Knowit. But the two above is very
important to be, no matter how silly it may look.</p>
