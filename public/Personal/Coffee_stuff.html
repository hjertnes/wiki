<p>I've been into coffee stuff for a long time. Almost ten years at this point. I don't do that much fancy stuff at the moment. Mostly just making the best possible coffee with good but inexpensive coffee from the store. Usually with a Moccamaster.</p>
<p>When I did more fancy stuff I used to do a lot of V60 at the end, before that I often did a lot of Aeropress or Moccapot.</p>
<p>The most important thing when it comes to coffee however is not the gear, but the coffee itself. Figure out what style you prefer and get gear that makes the best of that coffee. I'd get a good grinder, but my experience is that grinders usually either make good medium or good fine grained. The other gear are usually very inexpensive.</p>
