<p>I've been into coffee stuff for a long time. Almost ten years at this
point. I don't do that much fancy stuff at the moment. Mostly just
making the best possible coffee with good but inexpensive coffee from
the store. Usually with a Moccamaster.</p>
<p>When I did more fancy stuff I used to do a lot of V60 at the end, before
that I often did a lot of Aeropress or Moccapot.</p>
<p>The most important thing when it comes to coffee however is not the
gear, but the coffee itself. Figure out what style you prefer and get
gear that makes the best of that coffee. I'd get a good grinder, but my
experience is that grinders usually either make good medium or good fine
grained. The other gear are usually very inexpensive.</p>
