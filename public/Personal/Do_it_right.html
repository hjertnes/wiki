<li>When you write code (probably applies to a lot of other stuff) you can make something that just works or something good.</li>
<li>It is about doing it right.</li>
<li>It is about making it work well, being fast, fails gracefully, having tests. The code is clean.</li>
<li>You know, right.</li>
<li>At work, and other places I see too much of work that is just about getting something good enough that it is passable for something that can run in production.</li>
<li>It is crap, and it never pays off. Because someone always have to either stich it together over and over or do the work to fix it.</li>
<li>We need to stop this shit and do better work no matter how much pressure we have on ourself.</li>
<li>We should never do anything less than "right".</li>
