<li>When you write code (probably applies to a lot of other stuff) you
can make something that just works or something good.</li>
<li>It is about doing it right.</li>
<li>It is about making it work well, being fast, fails gracefully,
having tests. The code is clean.</li>
<li>You know, right.</li>
<li>At work, and other places I see too much of work that is just about
getting something good enough that it is passable for something that
can run in production.</li>
<li>It is crap, and it never pays off. Because someone always have to
either stich it together over and over or do the work to fix it.</li>
<li>We need to stop this shit and do better work no matter how much
pressure we have on ourself.</li>
<li>We should never do anything less than &quot;right&quot;.</li>
