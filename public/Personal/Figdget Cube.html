<p>I finally bought one. I've had it on my list since I first heard about
it in 2014 or something.</p>
<p>It is awesome. I love it. One of the great things about working from
home is that I can fidget with it and keep focus in the meeting I'm in
without annoying everyone.</p>
<p>I guess a lot of people don't get that. But for some of us, doing stuff
like doodling, or fidgeting with something improves our ability to focus
on meetings</p>
