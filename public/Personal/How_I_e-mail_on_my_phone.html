<li>So I don't like to use a lot of time refreshing inboxes and shit on my phone. That is why stopped listening to podcasts and it is the reason I don't have RSS on my phone.</li>
<li>So, I use Mail.app for email on my phone. But I don't leave the accounts active. So when I need to do something with eiter my work or my private account. I go into settings enable it an then I do what ever I had to and then I disable it again.</li>
<li>It isn't very annoying. But just enough for me to never sit there and refresh my inboxes.</li>
