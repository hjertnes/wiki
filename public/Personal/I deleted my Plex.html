<p>I used to have a very large Plex library, with a lot of movies and TV shows etc. It was close to 5TB. It became a mayjor pain in the ass to manage. Both to back up, find disk setups it worked well with etc. So at some point I just deleted all of the stuff that wasn't unwatched. And moved it to the system drive of my MacBook.</p>
<p>Suddenly it was all much more fun again.</p>
<p>I never keep stuff around after I've watched it. Much easier to manage.</p>
