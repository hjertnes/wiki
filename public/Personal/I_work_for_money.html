<p>I try to keep my work home life balanace as plain as possible. The
reason I work is because of money. If I did not have to do that I would
work on very different projects.
The way I look at it work pays for a certain amount of time per year.
And I try to keep it as close to that amount as possible. But giving
them moe than they pay for, for good will. But not a lot.
Unlike most people, I usually don't go to most work parties. I usually
go to team parties, but I skip the whole company parties.
It would probably be different if I worked in a smaller company.</p>
