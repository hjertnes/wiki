<p>At this point I have been doing this for about two months, but I have used a lot of time over the last year and a half preparing myself to follow what I talk about here in the long run</p>
<p>I have lost 7.5KG, and I plan to loose another 58KG to get well within a healthy BMI.</p>
<p>In order for this to work out for me, I have decided to do this in a slow way. My plan is to loose 0.2KG a week. At this point it is going much faster, but that is my goal. But to make this actually work in the long run I decided to make as little changes as possible. Before I move on to talking about what I have done I'm going to say this: I have not increased how much I excersise and I have not changed what I eat.</p>
<p>My approach have been to do calorie tracking:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have set a goal where I try to loose 0.2 a week</li>
<li>I have configured it to increase the budget based on activly burnt calories form my Apple Watch</li>
<li>I track everything, but I don't care that much that it is very acurate</li>
<li>I allow myself to break the budget once a week</li>
<li>If I constantly eat less than the budget I decrease it</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point I can eat anything, but not unlimited amounts, and not all at the same time.</p>
<p>I'm going to edit this as I continue to do it</p>
