<p>Minimalism is something I think most people don't understand.</p>
<p>A lot of people think of it as having nothing. But that is not true.
Minimalism is about having as little as possible. To get rid of
everything that isn't essential.</p>
<p>The way I go about it is to try to get rid of everything that doesn't
improve my life.</p>
<p>We all have a lot of stuff, that is just stuff. Doesn't improve our
lives at all. That is the stuff to get rid of.</p>
<p>For me, minimalism is more about the practise of questioning everything
rather than the act of having little stuff.</p>
