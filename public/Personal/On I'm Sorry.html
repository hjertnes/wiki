<p>When you say the words "I'm sorry" it can mean multiple things. It can be genuine and non genuine.</p>
<p>When it isn't genuine, it is usually used in a way to just get out of whatever trouble you are in. The genuine on the other hand has for what I can tell two variants. Either you feel bad about what you did, or you feel bad about how other reacted to something you did that you don't feel bad about.</p>
<p>The latter usually is the kind of "I feel bad how X made you feel", a lot of people consider them to be not genuine. But I don't think that is true in general. There are probably a lot of the excuses that come in that formula above that isn't genuine.</p>
