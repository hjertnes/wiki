<p>When you say the words &quot;I'm sorry&quot; it can mean multiple things. It
can be genuine and non genuine.
When it isn't genuine, it is usually used in a way to just get out of
whatever trouble you are in. The genuine on the other hand has for what
I can tell two variants. Either you feel bad about what you did, or you
feel bad about how other reacted to something you did that you don't
feel bad about.
The latter usually is the kind of &quot;I feel bad how X made you feel&quot;, a
lot of people consider them to be not genuine. But I don't think that
is true in general. There are probably a lot of the excuses that come in
that formula above that isn't genuine.</p>
