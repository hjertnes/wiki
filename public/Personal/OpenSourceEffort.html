<p>I wrote a lot of code, for fun. A lot of people probably don't get that. But it is one of the things I really enjoy doing. And I'm lucky enough to get to do that as my job. But then I do other kinds of programming for fun.</p>
<p>I'm doing my best to not let all my stuff just lay around in on my laptop. This is an efftor that I have been working on for years. This is my goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>If something isn't something that I work on where the plan is a comerical product, I'll make it available on my Sourcehut profile</li>
<li>Try to always make some basic docs on how to run and deal with it</li>
<li>This means that I have to deal with keeping credentials and all kinds of other stuff out of the code from day one.</li>
</ul>
