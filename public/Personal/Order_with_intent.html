<p>There are a lot of stuff around no matter what your hobby is that you
could buy. I usually don't buy that many things that end up not working
out for me.
The reason is that I have a really slow process that keeps me from
buying most stuff. When I see something interesting I add it to a list I
keep of all the shit I want to get. Then later I look over all of it and
remove the stuff I didn't find interesting, and the rest are moved to
another list. That one I also look at sometimes, and before I buy
something (the exception here is entertainment) I need to find a place
for it. If I can't find something I want to use it for, and a reason
for not using something I already own (if anything is usable for it) I
don't get it.
Like I said it is really slow, and most stuff are just ignored.
But it keeps me from wasting money on stuff.</p>
