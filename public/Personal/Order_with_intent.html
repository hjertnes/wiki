<p>There are a lot of stuff around no matter what your hobby is that you could buy. I usually don't buy that many things that end up not working out for me.</p>
<p>The reason is that I have a really slow process that keeps me from buying most stuff. When I see something interesting I add it to a list I keep of all the shit I want to get. Then later I look over all of it and remove the stuff I didn't find interesting, and the rest are moved to another list. That one I also look at sometimes, and before I buy something (the exception here is entertainment) I need to find a place for it. If I can't find something I want to use it for, and a reason for not using something I already own (if anything is usable for it) I don't get it.</p>
<p>Like I said it is really slow, and most stuff are just ignored.</p>
