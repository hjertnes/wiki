<p>I did not do so when I wrote donw the idea for this blog post, but I did
a while after.</p>
<p>I re-installed Overcast. Deleted everything in there. And then I
subscribed to everything Dan Carlin. But that is just like 3-4 podcasts
per year.</p>
<p>And then I re-subscribed to Two Headed Girl.</p>
<p>That was about it. For a really long time. But when I got into learning
myself Go I also subscribed to GoTime a weekly podcast about Go. And a
while later Emacs cast.</p>
<p>At this point only one of them publish weekly or in any way regular. So
I kind of just open Overcast once a month and listen if there are
anything new.</p>
<p>I'm not at all back into podcasting. And I have zero interest in
re-subscribing to any of the stuff I used to listen to.</p>
<p>Most of the Apple Tech stuff bore me to death.</p>
