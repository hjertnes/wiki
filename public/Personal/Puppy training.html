<p>Not sure what it is called around the world. But it is common here in Norway to go to a "puppy traning" class when you get a puppy here.</p>
<p>Usually done by some dog training school, and larger cities usually have a few options at any time. I recommend going to one where you feel aligned with the school.</p>
<p>I'm personally a big fan of positive reinforcement and clicker based traning.</p>
<p>We did not do this with our first dog (Luna) for a number of reasons, and always regretted it. And I strongly recommend doing it with all puppies. The reason is simple, you get an introduction that hopefully will make you better capable of understanding and interacting with your new best friend. And the good schools also let the dogs play with eachother and a lot of very important socialization.</p>
