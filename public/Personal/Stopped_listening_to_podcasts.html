<p>When I first got into podcasts for the second time I loved it. They were all fresh it felt like this counter culture revolution of radio. And I loved it for a long time. I from 2010 or 2011 until 2018 it was a majority of what I listened to, everything in periods.</p>
<p>But at some point, it got boring. It just felt like the same shit over and over. Too mnay podcasts talking about the same shit. Or entire series of podcasts just talking about the same thing from different angles.</p>
<p>So I started to get rid of podcasts. And some I added back and then I removed them again.</p>
<p>From easter 2018 until August of 2019 I removed stuff, and when I had 2 or 3 left I decided to just get rid of them entirely.</p>
<p>I might get back into it at some point. But as I am writing this in the end of October 2019 I don't think it will happen in a while.</p>
<p>And I love using the time I previously used on podcasts to listen to audioboks and Music.</p>
<p>I have started to really expolore genres I previously didn't have much exposure to (by choice). I don't really expose myself to TV, radio or anything the rest of the world are following.</p>
