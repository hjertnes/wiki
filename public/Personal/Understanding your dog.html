<p>To understand your dog can be hard to some people. But I think it is to
a large extent very easy. That doesn't mean I think it is easy to use
that to get dogs to behave as I'd like.</p>
<p>There are basically two ways to get a dog to do as you'd like: fear or
treats. I prefer treats, because you feel much better about it and it
has much less negative side effects.</p>
<p>Most of what a dog does is instinct or simple gratification. They run
out the open door because it is fun to run around. And they steal the
food from the table because food taste good. And they break your sofa
because it was exciting smells coming out of that tiny hole that
suddenly got bigger as the snout got inside it.</p>
<p>But most things you don't want a dog to do can be circumvented by
traning them to always come to you when you call by giving them treats
when they do.</p>
<p>Also: most bad behaviour come from people encouraging it by for example
giving them food by the table.</p>
