<p>I spend way more time listening to music, podcasts and audiobooks; and reading stuff, than I do watchint movies and tv shows.</p>
<p>Not sure why. But all of them are much easier to do a little here and there than watching movies and shows. And also because audio entertainment work way better as something you do while doing something else.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>I wish I had more time to watch movies and shows, because there is nothing like them when they are great.</p>
