<p>I have this place and I have my blog. What goes where?
Most of the time I think it's obvious what goes where. But sometimes it is not.
In general the rules are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The blog contains things that matters now but probably don't matter later</li>
<li>It also has a few pages that might belong here. But are on the blog because they feel more at home there.</li>
<li>This wiki is for small or large texts that are linked together with links and backlinks. Where the intent is to update things as time goes by</li>
<li>The blog has a rss feed this wiki has not</li>
<li>The blog is a stream of &quot;updates&quot; while this is more like a huge document</li>
</ul>
