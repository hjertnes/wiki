<p>Getting a manual 35mm film camera have been the thing I have learnt the most about photography from.</p>
<p>Having to adjust all the parameters manually have thought me how to work efficiently with them on all cameras.</p>
<p>You need to adjust shutter speed, f-stop and focus; and pick a ISO speed and stick to it for the entire film. Sometimes you use a film that is unusable for the situation and you need to change it. And that means wasting money.</p>
<p>What I do a lot of the time shooting analog is that I set the shutter speed to 1/50th of a second, the slowest I can shoot handheld without having to think aobut it and then I just adjust f-spot. To make zooming easy I also a lot of them time always go for the biggest f-stop possible, unless I'm for some reason really want a shallow depth of field.</p>
<p>Back in my street shooting days I used to just pre-set everything and wait until some subject walked into the distanced I had zoomed for.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and if you can shoot in f8 almost everything is in focus.</p>
<p>I placed a Contigo mug with the Autoseal system, because it was really hard to clean and the system broke down after about a year.</p>
