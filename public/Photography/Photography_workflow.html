<p>I Shoot in burst</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I have a few SD cards filled up I import them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I make a folder with todays date</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I rename the folder to DCIM1, DCIM2 etc before I copy it to the
folder I created in step 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I have copied all of them to my Mac, I run a script that moves
all te jpg files to a JPEG folder and all the raw files to a RAW
folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then I copy it to my archive drive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that I import the JPEG's into Photos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then I process them, usually delete 90% of the photos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Export the once I kept to a folder called &quot;Exported on DATE&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Flickr uploadr will pick it up and upload it to Flickr</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When all of that is done I delete te folder from my Mac and review
the stuff uploaded to Flickr. Then I make all the stuff I want to be
public public. The rest are left private for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the time I have the 23mm on my X-Pro, if I'm going
somewhere with it I usually also bring the 50mm; sometimes I bring
the two other lenses but usually not. I usually bring all my
batteries, and I have this SD card case that makes it easy to bring
all my SD cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After years of being unhappy with the time I took and what I got out
of it I have stopped my Lightroom based workflow I started shooting
JPEG + RAW, add the jpegs to Apple Photos and process them, and I
just stick the RAW's on an external drive. I shoot with the Acros
preset on my camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm usually more happy with those results than I ever was with
Lightroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't do any processing on the raw files, but I don't keep them
forever. I keep the current year + the one before. Like when 2021
starts I'll delete anything shot before 2020.</p>
