<p>What is a good lens for street photography?</p>
<p>What you want from a lens when you do street photography is something light and compact, because those grams really adds up if you walk around for 8 hours shooting. And haivng a very fast lens is not that important. Maybe if you shoot at night or in dark places. But a lens like a f/2 or f/2.8 is more than fast enough.</p>
<p>Some techniques I used to use when I shot street: I used manual focus, because you don't want to wait for it, set it to f/8 because then most of it is in focus anyways, and shutter speed and ISO to auto. WIth those settings you can just shoot without waiting much.</p>
<p>When it comes to focal lenghts it all depends on taste, I prefer a 50mm for street. A lot of people like a 35mm or 28mm. It all depends on how close you want to get. If you think people will discover you easier with a wider lens getting closer, my expereince is the oposite. I shot a lot of street with a 12mm, and with that you can almost touch them with the lens without them thinking you are shooting them.</p>
<p>Anyways. I like a 50mm because it is easier to control what is in the frame than with something wider.</p>
