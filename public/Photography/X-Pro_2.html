<p>I have been using my X-Pro 2 for close to three years now. The 3 have have some cool features that I'd like, but I'm not getting it before this one breaks.</p>
<p>I love it as a camera, and I am never going back to a SLR style camera if I have a choice.</p>
<p>I enjoy shooting with it, and I love the photos I get out of it without any editing. The one thing I miss is better battery life. Not a huge issue, and it can be solved by carry and a few of them.</p>
