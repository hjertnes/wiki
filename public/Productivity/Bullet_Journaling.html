<p>I use Bullet Journal as a Getting Things Done like system. Beacuse of details that does not matter a paper system like Bullet Journaling will never be fully compatible with GTD for many details that does not matter.</p>
<p>Notation:</p>
<ul>
<li>I use the Dashplus notation from Patrick Rhone instead of the offical one, because I like it better and I have used it since way before Bullet Journal was a thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paper and stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>I use a LT1917 A5 Hardcover Dotgrid notebook, in a Seed cover from Nock.co. And I use various fountain pens usually a Lamy 2000 or a Pilot Vanishing Point.</li>
<li>The notebooks I use have two markers, and I use them to mark the first page I still have open items and the last page I have written something. One of the things I do a lot of is to transition items or move them to a new page. This is because I think it becomes harder to manage it I get beyond 30 pages of things.</li>
