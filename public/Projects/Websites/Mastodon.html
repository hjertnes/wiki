<p>I run a small mastodon instance on <a href="https://dog.estate">https://dog.estate</a>. The reason I started it was because the instances I wanted to join didn't approve me and none of the other that was open for registration at the moment felt right.</p>
<p>So I started my own. For a long time it was just me. These days it also includes two online friends of mine.</p>
<p>I have no plans of running anything large. Anyone I know isn't terrible can potenially get an account, they just have to ask me.</p>
