<p>I run a small mastodon instance on <a href="https://dog.estate">https://dog.estate</a>. The reason I
started it was because the instances I wanted to join didn't approve me
and none of the other that was open for registration at the moment felt
right.
So I started my own. For a long time it was just me. These days it also
includes two online friends of mine.
I have no plans of running anything large. Anyone I know isn't terrible
can potenially get an account, they just have to ask me.</p>
