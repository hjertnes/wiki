<h1>Link sharing workflow</h1>
<div><ul>
<li><a href="/Notes/index.html">Notes</a></li>
<li><a href="/Setup/index.html">Setup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All links I see online I want to read or check out are sent to
Instapaper. Then at some later point I read it, and mark it with a
&quot;like&quot; if this is something I want to share and add it to drafts(and
later OmniFocus) if I want to do something with it like buy it or learn
it etc. I share up to 50 likes every friday, so I have this constant
flow of stuff.</p>
<p>This is how I do it, and it is not a pretty workflow because I have no
access to the Instapaper API</p>
<ul>
<li>My likes that have not been shared yet are stored in a list of links
in a file named likes.org, when there are less than 50 lines in it I
do the following</li>
<li>I download a CSV export from Instapaper</li>
<li>I run <a href="https://github.com/hjertnes/instapaper2org">this</a> go program
and paste the output into my org document</li>
<li>I run a M-x command to sort the lines and remove duplicates</li>
<li>Then I go into the instapaper website, click likes and run the
javascript snippet below until all likes are removed</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Object.values($(&quot;.action_link.star_toggle.starred&quot;)).map(x =&gt; $.get(x.href).then(y =&gt; {}))
</code></pre>
