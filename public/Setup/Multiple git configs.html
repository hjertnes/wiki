<p>The other week I was looking for a way to get my git config to work like
I want on my work machine. I wanted it to use different e-mail addresses
based on what folder the repo was it. My setup is simple: ~/Code and
.emacs.d is where my personal stuff lives and all the work stuff is in
~/KnowitCode.</p>
<p>The reason they are seperated is that my personal stuff is in Git and
synced over Dropbox. And I'm not allowed to have work code on non work
machines. So this is how it is set up.</p>
<p>Then I found this

blog post, describing how you can configure git to override a default
config based on paths.</p>
<p>It solved all my problems in a great way. I don't even have to think
about it.</p>
