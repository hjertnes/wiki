<h1>A Vanishing Point with CON-70?</h1>

<p>I really love my newest pen, the CON-70. And, then, I got this idea
after a few days of using the pen. Damn, I want a Vanishing Point with
this converter. Like I have said many times, I don't think the 0.4 or
0.5 you can get into the standard converter is enough.</p>
<p>I usually can get through one or multiple days with that. Except for
when I en up writing a lot by hand. Then I run through the converter
<em>fast</em>. It's not about that, it's rather the fact that I hate to have
to worry about it. I never do with my Lamy 2000 or TWSBI pens.</p>
<p>The reason I worry is that I have filled it in the morning, and written
it dry before the day was over more than once.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>A Vanishing Point with a larger converter, would mean that the pen would
also be larger, and it would be heavier. This would probably make it
even less accessible to women. And that sucks. But, I'm not saying
&quot;scrap the existing one and make this one&quot;. I'm saying make this in
addition. everything you want is included. And React or Vue are good
places to start for when you want to do Web App Development.</p>
<p>How you learn the basics are up to you. Some people like to watch video
lessons, while others like a more interactive approach and I prefer
books and blog posts. How you do it is up to you, but I would encourage
you to try different methods and stick with what works for you.</p>
<p>And the final step to get started is to find a project. If you are doing
a web development, making a custom CMS is a good place to start. Not
because you'll get the most amazing thing every. But just because you
will learn a lot from doing it. Everything from server side rendering on
what people will see and more advanced Web App development on the admin
side of it.</p>
<p>A todo app is a good place to start, if you are doing an native app; but
also works if you are doing a web app.</p>
<p>Then I would encourage you to make what every you are making as good as
you have the time for. And always improve everything as you learn new
stuff. A solid project that shows how you work and what you can do is
always useful when you are going to apply for a job.</p>
<p>There will be a lot of &quot;abstractions&quot; no matter what kind of software
development you get into. They are a way to make more complicated or
time consuming tasks easier to work with. The good thing about them is
that you don't need to know all the details when you start out. The bad
thing is that you need to learn more things. But I would still take the
time to learn to theory behind them as you get more experience.</p>
<p>If you decide that you would like to make a living as a developer then I
would start by looking at what kind of languages, frameworks and
technology are popular in your area. And the best way to do that is by
looking a job listings. And then start learning that. The next step is
to have some code you can share with potential employers when you apply
for a job. The closer the code is to what they use the better it is. It
is just a way to show them that you actually know how to do the job.
Because the biggest nightmare when we hire is to get someone who don't
know how to code.</p>
