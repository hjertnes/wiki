<p>The common thing about al bad paper is that it kind of soaks up the ink
instead of drying on top of it. A lot of people hate how it looks, and
this is called feathering.</p>
<p>Bad paper can either be think causing things like fountain pens to bleed
through multiple pages or have thicker paper where that usually don't
happen.</p>
<p>I used to use bad thicker paper for a long time as my go to. The reason
was that it was easy to buy locally and it dired way faster than better
paper.</p>
