<p>This is really weird, but back when I got into fountain pens I had to order more or less everything I liked from America. There were probably some German or British places to get it. But honestly it is cheaper to get it from the US.</p>
<p>A lot have changed from then. There are multiple Norwegian online stores, where I buy most of what I need. And I have also seen physical stores selling my go to notebooks and fountain pens.</p>
