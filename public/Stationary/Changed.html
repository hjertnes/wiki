<p>This is really weird, but back when I got into fountain pens I had to
order more or less everything I liked from America. There were probably
some German or British places to get it. But honestly it is cheaper to
get it from the US.
A lot have changed from then. There are multiple Norwegian online
stores, where I buy most of what I need. And I have also seen physical
stores selling my go to notebooks and fountain pens.</p>
