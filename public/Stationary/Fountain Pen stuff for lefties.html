</ul>
<p>It is no need to not go into fountain pens, just because you are left
handed. There are a lot of things you can do to limit the problems of
smuding. And with some training you can learn some techniques that limit
the need for being limited to stuff with short dry time.</p>
<ul>
<li>LT1917: great paper that in my impression have among the fastest dry
times.</li>
<li>Noodlers Bernanke: I hate the owner. But this ink dries more or less
immediatly</li>
<li>Finer nibs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I still use LT1917, but I have never been that into finer nibs. And I
mostly just use Iroshizuku inks.</p>
<p>But I recommend making it as easy as possible in the beginning. And then
slowly go nuts as you can used to things.</p>
