<p>I have had some kind of a website online since 98 or 99.</p>
<p>At some point in 2010 or 2011 I decided that I would like to become a
better writer, and I just started to write a lot.</p>
<p>Then I started to blog.</p>
<p>After trying to write about Apple and Tech for a really long time, I
decided to try something different in 2015. So I started the InkSmudge.
And after a tweet to Brad Dowdy of the Pen Addict 100 or 1000 times more
traffic and subscribes than I ever had on any of my previous attempts.</p>
<p>Then I freaked out and used years to get comfortable with it.</p>
<p>For a really long time it made sense to have seperate web sites. But at
this point it is just a bunch of extra work for me. And I have just
continued writing a bunch of stuff for like a year even though I would
have made more sense to combine the sites.</p>
<p>This means that I am going to write less about stationary stuff. But
I'm still going to write some about it. And my overall goal is to
continue writing 3 posts a week as I did when I had two different sites.</p>
<p>This section is like a blog, just without a rss feed. There are things
like this in other parts. But these are stuff that formerly was under
Personal. And they may move, but corrently don't have a better room</p>
