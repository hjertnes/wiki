<p>I love writing in notebooks.</p>
<p>My most productive phases as a writer is when I just set off some time each week where I focus on just filling a certain number of pages in a notebook.</p>
<p>The main reason they work so great for me instead of using something digital is that they don't let me jump into doing something else like IRC or Mastodon. If I have a list of topics to write about and a notebook and a pen there is not a lot more I can do than fill those pages.</p>
<p>And at the end of a 250 page notebook I have filled a book. It feels like I completed something. I don't keep all of them anymore. But it is fun filling a section of a bookcase with stuff you wrote.</p>
