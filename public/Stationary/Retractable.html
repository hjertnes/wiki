<p>There are a few retractable fountain pens on the market. Most notably the Pilot Vanishing Point, and Lamy has a model. Plus I think Mont Blanc have some as well.</p>
<p>Anyways. The last time I looked into things there was only one <strong>good</strong> retractable fountain pen: The Vanishing Point. I think it is a huge problem.</p>
<p>First of all, the only way to drive innovation, design and price is when there are real competition.</p>
<p>I don't use my VP a lot. But sometimes I do. There are some things about it I don't like</p>
<ul>
<li>The converter holds too little inks</li>
<li>It is a slow starter</li>
<li>The design is weird</li>
<li>The location of a clip is not good for a lot of left handed people. I don't mind it, but a lot of people do.</li>
<li>I have also heard that the size of the pens isn't the best for women.</li>
</ul>
