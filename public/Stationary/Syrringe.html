<p>If you have a fountain pen with a converter you have probably noticed
that you never can fill them all up in a non messy way. I spend years
trying to figure it out. If you wonder why I would care about it, it is
just that with most converters it's like 25-30% that is empty.</p>
<p>There are situation where that difference are the difference between
running out of ink before the day is over or not.</p>
<p>If you use a syrringe you can fill it all the way up in seconds.</p>
