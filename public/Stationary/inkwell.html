<p>I have tried to find a good inkwell since I got my third bottle of ink. But I still not found one. What I mean by inkwell is a think you pour a bottle of ink into. The reason I have wanted one is that some bottles of ink aren't the best to fill from.</p>
<p>Not something I really need, but it would have been nice. Especially when you use inks with terrible botltes that are a pain to get the last part out of.</p>
