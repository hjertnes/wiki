<p>1Password is a password manager, it used to be on just OS X, then OS X
and iOS; these days also on Android and Windows. Plus anything that runs
Firefox or Chrome. The legit versions that can install extentions.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of borwser extentions for 1Password, there are
&quot;1Password&quot; and &quot;1Password X&quot;. The main differnece between the two
is that the latter is a full client that doesn't require the desktop
app to work. This has the added advantage that 1Password X works on
Chrome OS and Linux.</p>
<p>I have used both of them a lot, and mostly used X over the last few
years. These days they are more or less the same. In the past the user
experience was better on X.</p>
<p>Agile bits also works on a Linux version of their Desktop app, so I
guess I won't need X for my use.</p>
