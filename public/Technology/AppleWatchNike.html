<p>The Sport Loop I got with my Apple Watch when it was new two years ago,
started to have some serious issues lately. Namely that it kind of
almost fell of me while running. So I ordered a new one Apple Watch 44mm
Nike Sport Loop. It looks really awesome, and has none of the issues I
had with my old worn down band.</p>
<p>This is something that havve bothered me about Apple Watch bands in the
past. They work really great for about a year, and then they start to
break down. I wish Apple was clearer about expected life them with them.</p>
<p>I really love how my new one look.</p>
