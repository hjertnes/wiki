I recently went back into Things from OmniFocus. I like it a lot. It isn't as complex as OmniFocus. For good or for bad. But it has some interesting features that makes it doable to maintain a much simpler structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>OmniFocus has Folders, Projects, Tasks and Sub-Tasks. You can use that to nest things into insanity. While things has Area's, Projects, Headlines and Tasks. There are no nestings.</p>
<p>A project is or is not under an Area. A project have tasks under them, or headlines that can have tasks under them.</p>
<p>The headlines have replaced a lot of folder structures for me.</p>
