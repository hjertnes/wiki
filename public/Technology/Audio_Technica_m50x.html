<p>I got a pair of Audio-technica m50x about a year ago. And they are awesome. Very comfortable. But I get a little bit sweaty when I use them for hours after hours after hours. But that isn't really somethin that could be solved without getting open backed ones.</p>
<p>I have that on my wish list, but not really sure when I'm going to pull the trigger on that.</p>
<p>But I really like them, and the only way I'd get much better comfort and quality would be if I went for some expensive headphones and amplifier togeter with a TIDAL or something.</p>
<p>If the dogs ate them today, I'd order another pair.</p>
