<p>I got a pair of Audio-technica m50x about a year ago. And they are
awesome. Very comfortable. But I get a little bit sweaty when I use them
for hours after hours after hours. But that isn't really somethin that
could be solved without getting open backed ones.
I have that on my wish list, but not really sure when I'm going to pull
the trigger on that.
But I really like them, and the only way I'd get much better comfort
and quality would be if I went for some expensive headphones and
amplifier togeter with a TIDAL or something.
If the dogs ate them today, I'd order another pair.</p>
