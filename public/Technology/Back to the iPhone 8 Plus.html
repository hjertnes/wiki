<p>I left my old job, and are starting a new one soon. So I had to return my work supplied iPhone 11, and went back to my iPhone 8 Plus.</p>
<p>It is weird going back to a phone with a home button and finger id.</p>
<p>But it didn't take too many days before I was used to it. And then I probably have to go back to a FaceID thingy soon.</p>
<p>I haven't noticed any performance differences between them. But the battery life is much worse, even with similar battery health rating. And I have noticed that this screen size is much more comfortable to type on with my fingers.</p>
