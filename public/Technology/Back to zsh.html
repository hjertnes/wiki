<h1>Going back to zsh</h1>

<p>I used bash without much of customization beyond changing EDITOR and
PATH for the longest time, and then I got into zsh at some point. And
for years I dragged along this configuration that was copy pasted junk.</p>
<p>It was like 100s of lines. And at some point I merged it with the
default oh-my-zsh config.</p>
<p>Then at various points I have tried to migrate to fish. But there is
always something that breaks with it. Some times it was a lack of &amp;&amp;
support. Then a few months ago I had to leave it again, this time it was
because the autocomplete got all fucked up because I have a bunch of
commands where I just write a bunch of text.</p>
<p>I miss some of fish's features. But outside of the fish autocomplete
the setup is more or less the same for me.</p>
<p>This time I did something different though.</p>
<p>I deleted everything and started from scratch.</p>
<p>It will hopefully sick for a while. My shell setups usually last for
like 2-3 years.</p>
