<p>I recently got these for running and other things where I want something
lighter than my large headphones.
So long so good. They're comfortable, the sound is good for what they
are and they don't fall out when I'm running.
My AirPods never fell out either, but it always felt like they almost
did. And the sound in these are much better than the AirPods.
I also love that the case let you click them into a slot instead of just
dropping them in. I always had problems getting the AirPods to charge
properly.</p>
