<p>I have been looking for a better microphone setup for work meetings
since the pandemic started.</p>
<p>At my previous work we got these Jambra over the ear headsets with the
microphone on a stick in front of your head. I hated everything about
it. The headset wasn't good for music, and I didn't think it was
combortable to wear. And the whole microphone thingy made me really
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>When I changed jobs I decided to find something better. I decided it had
to be an external microphone because the stick thingy made be
uncomfortable, and the mic on a cable thingy doesn't work well with a
beard. And I prefer to use the same microphone for listening to music
and to attend meetings.</p>
<p>In general I prefer to have multiple seperate things instead of a
combined thingy. If I want to get a better microphone I don't need to
take anything but the microphone into consideration.</p>
<p>I landed on a Blue Snowball ICE. It isn't anything fancy like what most
podcasters use. But it is much better than the built in microphone in a
few aspects.</p>
<ul>
<li>It isolates out background stuff much better</li>
<li>I'm able to be much closer to it than the built in one with my
homeoffice setup</li>
<li>It isn't located in a way where it becomes useless if the fan spins
on my computer. At multiple times I've had to shut down docker,
dropbox or a lot of what I am doing for people to hear me.</li>
</ul>
