<p>I use Firefox Developer Edition on my &quot;real&quot; computers and Safari on
my iPhone.</p>
<p>Back when I used a Mac at work, my setup was usually Safari for browsing
and Chrome for edevelopment and sometimes just Chrome or just Firefox.
These days I want all of my desktop browsing setup to be in one
browsers, with support for syncing and all of that. I don't want to
deal with keeping multiple setups kind of similar.</p>
<p>So I just use one browser.</p>
<p>Safari is a good browser, but isn't cross platform and their plugin
development community isn't good enough.
Chrome isn't something I can support because I think Google and</p>
<p>Facebook are evil</p>
<p>Brave is obviously out because it was funded by the father of Javascript
who was fired from Mozilla because he was a homophobic asshole.
At this point I won't use anything that use Chromium as its base.</p>
<p>Mozilla is usually a company that line up with my concerns and opinions
and the browser may not be as good as Chrome in some areas it is as good</p>
<p>in like 95% of the time.</p>
<p>This is probably a loosing battle. But it feels good to take a stand.
Currently testing out Safari again, because I'll be back on the Mac
full time in my new job</p>
