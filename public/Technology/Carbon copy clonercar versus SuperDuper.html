<p>I used SuperDuper as my clone tool of choice for years. Most likely 2010
until 2020.</p>
<p>Then I earlier this year dumped it.</p>
<p>I still prefer the simplicity of SuperDuper. But CCC is much better when
you clone more than one drive. After the initial setup I just connect
CCC, leave it. And it will clone my system drive, and deplicate my
Archive 1 drive to the Archive 2 drive if it hasn't been done in 4
days.</p>
<p>I usually just connect it every saturday, leave it for an hour or so and
it's all done.</p>
<p>CCC is a tool made for setting up &quot;tasks&quot; e.g something you do all the
time. While SuperDuper is better suited for if you do one tasks every
time or do a different task every time. Not going to go all nuts with
BTT though.</p>
