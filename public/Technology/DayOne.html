<p>Day One is the only journaling app I have actually really used over the
years. I wrote in it every day for a really long time. And then I quit
doing that for various reasons.</p>
<p>Then I decided to move out of it a while back.</p>
<p>I have now decided to start doing some journaling in it again.</p>
<p>Not like I do in org-roam. But I'm going to sit down and to write
something like a really nice blog post with pictures if available a few
times a year. This will not be a high volume thing. Maybe 10-12 itemes a
year. It intent is that this is something I could print in a book some
day.</p>
