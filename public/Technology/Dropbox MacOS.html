<h1>The MacOS Dropbox app</h1>

<p>It used to be a solid app, that was sparse and performant.</p>
<p>These days it is a slow resource hog that I don't understand the point
with. My gut feeling is that Dropbox tries to turn themselves into a
company that does more than to sync that Dropbox folder.</p>
<p>I don't want or need that. I've come back to them after years of not
using them. And I'd prefer to have the 2015 version of their app back.</p>
