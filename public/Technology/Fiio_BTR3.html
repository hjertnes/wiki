<p>Got it in the middle of May 2019</p>
<p>I have used a bluetooth DAC from AFiio called Btr3 for over six months now. The reason I got it was because the experience of using a lightning to jack dongle while having my iPhone in a pocket was a miserable nightmare of disconnections all the time.</p>
<p>And I did not want a pair with bluetooth built in because the options are limited and expensive. Also because if the bluetooth break, you have to replace the whole thing.</p>
<p>The total price is about the same as the flagship headphones from Sony or Bose. But I think you can get much better headphones. And you can replace the bluetooth unit or the headphone unit independently.</p>
<p>The experience is a little bit worse. But I think the whole package is better.</p>
