<p>I had a problem with my fish config, that finally had gotten to the
point where I had to fix it. I know when it was introduced (now), but
didn't then. The result was that I in the process did something I have
had on my to do list for a really long time.</p>
<p>I deleted everything. And re-wrote it. I also in the process got rid of
everything I didn't really need that was in there because I thought it
was &quot;neat&quot; when I first set up fish.</p>
<p>The problem was that it took several seconds to start a shell. And the
reason this was happening was that in one of my path's I did something
dumb that was a really heavy command inside it.</p>
