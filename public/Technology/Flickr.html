<p>I recently got back into Flickr, or Jack tempted me.</p>
<p>Instead of sharing photos on Micro.blog I upload them to flickr. For a while I shared them as album on my blog. But now I don't do that anymore. I treat Flickr more as a isolated "network". Those who want to see them follow me on Flickr the rest won't see it.</p>
<p>My workflow is simple, when I have processed them in Photos I export them to a new folder named like "Exported on 2020-01-01", and the flickr uploader picks it up and uploads it all to a Album with the name of the folder. With the status of Private. Then later I look over it and make it public or some other sharing setting I seem appropriate.</p>
<p>I like it a lot. It feels a little bit like Instagram in a good way, but still works like a grown up photo sharing service.</p>
