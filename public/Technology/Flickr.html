<p>I recently got back into Flickr, or Jack tempted me.
Instead of sharing photos on Micro.blog I upload them to flickr. For a
while I shared them as album on my blog. But now I don't do that
anymore. I treat Flickr more as a isolated &quot;network&quot;. Those who want
to see them follow me on Flickr the rest won't see it.
My workflow is simple, when I have processed them in Photos I export
them to a new folder named like &quot;Exported on 2020-01-01&quot;, and the
flickr uploader picks it up and uploads it all to a Album with the name
of the folder. With the status of Private. Then later I look over it and
make it public or some other sharing setting I seem appropriate.
I like it a lot. It feels a little bit like Instagram in a good way, but
still works like a grown up photo sharing service.</p>
