<p>GNOME was my go to desktop enviornment for most of my Linux days back in
the old days. I was mostly a Linux except for 3 years when I also used a
Mac between 2002 and 2010.</p>
<p>For most of that time I either used GNOME (v2) or Fluxbox. Then at the
end I played around with GNOME v3 and Xmonad a little.</p>
<p>These days I'm using mostly GNOME Shell or what the hell it's called.
It is GNOME v3.</p>
<p>I think it has gotten very solid, and works really well. Most of works
kind of how I'd like a window manager to be. Mostly focused on
searching for the app you want to start.</p>
