<p>I have a Amazon Kindle; the cheapest Paperwhite model.
I think it is awesome, for many reasons; two of the main ones is that it
is small enough so I can bring it anywhere. The battery life is great.
And it does what it is trying to do really well.
Something that is really easy to do when you get a e-book reader is to
download more book than you can read in 10 years. So where is how I
manage it. I try to keep around 3 pages of books .I can let it go up to
5 but not more.
When it is less than 3 I start to buy stuff from my wish list. With this
system I can manage it fairly well. And it most of it is either deleted
or read within not too much time.</p>
