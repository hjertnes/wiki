<p>I have a Amazon Kindle; the cheapest Paperwhite model.</p>
<p>I think it is awesome, for many reasons; two of the main ones is that it is small enough so I can bring it anywhere. The battery life is great. And it does what it is trying to do really well.</p>
<p>Something that is really easy to do when you get a e-book reader is to download more book than you can read in 10 years. So where is how I manage it. I try to keep around 3 pages of books .I can let it go up to 5 but not more.</p>
<p>When it is less than 3 I start to buy stuff from my wish list. With this system I can manage it fairly well. And it most of it is either deleted or read within not too much time.</p>
