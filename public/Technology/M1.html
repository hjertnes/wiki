<p>Apple recently started to roll out computers with their own chips, like they do on most other hardware.</p>
<p>I just got a 16 MacBook Pro from work. When I started there almost three months ago. And I don't think I'd get a new one from them in at least a year and a half. Probably more like two years.</p>
<p>At the moment a M1 Mac would not work that well for me. At leat not until we have a functioning version of VMWare or Paralells. I don't use it a lot, but I do need it for some stuff from time to time. Another thing is that I'm not sure what the status of Docker on it is.</p>
<p>Until that is sorted out I can't use one.</p>
