<p>WHen I started my new job they got me a 16&quot; MBP. This is the second MacBook I have used that isn't a 13 inch.</p>
<p>It have taken quite a lot of getting used to.</p>
<p>I tried to get them to buy me a 13&quot; instead, but I just didn't want to make a big thing out of it.</p>
<p>How is it compared to my MacBook Escape?</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a lot bigger</li>
<li>The keyboard is way better</li>
<li>The touch id is awesome</li>
<li>Web Camera is still shit</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for between 2010 and the end of 2012 I have used computers that are 13 or smaller. And it took quite a lot of getting used to for me to enjoy using this computer on my lap. One large problem was that I had a hard time figuring out how to balance it.</p>
<p>I did not know this before I got it. But I did balance my 13 on one leg a lot. This does not work at all with this one. Another thing is that I used to have the palm of my hands on each corner and along the side of the laptop. This is another thing that doesn't work with something this large.</p>
<p>After 2.5 months of using it I have started to enjoy it more. But I'm still fairly certain that I'd probably have picked a 13&quot; would I pick one myself. All of this might change in time.</p>
