<p>I played around on Mastodon.Social for a few hours after leaving Micro.blog, and I decided to give it a go so I got a domain and made my own instance on <a href="https://dog.estate">https://dog.estate</a>. Curretly just me. But reach out if you want an account.</p>
<p>Here are some of my thoughts after being for a long time on Micro.blog</p>
<ul>
<li>I hate re-tweets, boosts or what ever. Most of the time.</li>
<li>It is silly how they have cooked up their own terms for everything twitter</li>
<li>If you get a handle from someone like <span class="citation" data-cites="JoeDouche">@JoeDouche</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Bros.social">@Bros.social</span> and you want to check them out on their instance because that will have all of their posts something your instance probably won't. You first need to re-write it to bros.social/<span class="citation" data-cites="JoeDouch">@JoeDouch</span> and then back again if you wish to follow him or her. This process should be a lot better.</li>
<li>It feels a lot more like twitter. But not as horrible. More like twitter 10 years ago, than twitter 5 years ago.</li>
<li>I feel much more welcome here than Micro.blog</li>
<li>My handle is: <span class="citation" data-cites="hjertnes">@hjertnes</span><span class="citation" data-cites="dog.estate">@dog.estate</span>.</li>
