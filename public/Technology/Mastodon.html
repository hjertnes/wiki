<h1>Mastodon</h1>

</ul>
<p>I played around on Mastodon.Social for a few hours after leaving
Micro.blog, and I decided to give it a go so I got a domain and made my
own instance on <a href="https://dog.estate">https://dog.estate</a>. Curretly just me. But reach out if
you want an account.</p>
<p>Here are some of my thoughts after being for a long time on Micro.blog</p>
<ul>
<li>I hate re-tweets, boosts or what ever. Most of the time.</li>
<li>It is silly how they have cooked up their own terms for everything
twitter</li>
<li>If you get a handle from someone like @JoeDouche@Bros.social and you
want to check them out on their instance because that will have all
of their posts something your instance probably won't. You first
need to re-write it to bros.social/@JoeDouch and then back again if
you wish to follow him or her. This process should be a lot better.</li>
<li>It feels a lot more like twitter. But not as horrible. More like
twitter 10 years ago, than twitter 5 years ago.</li>
<li>I feel much more welcome here than Micro.blog</li>
<li>My handle is: @hjertnes@dog.estate.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Federated timeline when it's not just you on the instance</h1>
<p>Back when it was just me on my mastodon instance the federated timeline
wasn't that useful, because it was more or less the same as my own
timeline. And the home timeline was just my crap.</p>
<p>But now that there are two more people there, I spend more and more time
looking at the federated one. Have found a few cool follows there.</p>
