<p>Markdown is a format that takes a sub set of HTML, that are commonly
used when writing and makes it really easy to write. Like headers,
links, images, making text bold, cursive etc. Everything in markdown has
a 1:1 mapping with HTML and when markdown don't support it you can use
regular HTML.</p>
<p>Taskpaper is a format for writing todo lists in plain texts. It has
concepts like projects, tasks, text and tags.</p>
<p>Org mode is a insane space ship that you can use for a long of different
stuff. The basics of org mode is a bunch of formatting and meta data
constructs. Like how ot make outlines, formatting text, linking things
together and adding meta-data either to files or notes in a outside. And
then you have ways of embedding code. Either as code you run from the
document or HTML that is embedded in it. Unlike markdown there is no 1:1
with HTML. And it can do most of what markdown can, but not all of it
while at the same time having similar features as taskapper. And there
are also a lot awesome features in emacs either built in or as packages
making it a insane powertool.</p>
