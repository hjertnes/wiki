<h1>Perl as sed</h1>

<p>Something I discovered while reading thosands of pages trying to find a good setup for doing search and replace with regular expressions on the command line</p>
<pre><code>perl -p -i -e 's/Barfoo/Foobar/g' *txt
</code></pre>
<p>The long story is that I want to do search and replace on the command line, and sed is mostly what I want. Except that I want modern regular expressions and sed only use the arcane unix stuff. AWK isn't really my kind of thing. It's kind of awkward.
Then I found the snippet above. It is mostly what I wanted.
Something that works more or less like sed, with modern regexp support. I'd much prefer it if someone made a modern sed with a perl compatible regular expression engine. But it works</p>
