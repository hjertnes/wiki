<p>When I got into running or started the &quot;couch to 5k&quot; programme in the middle of 2020, I initially used my large headphones. But it wasn't that practical. Then I digged out my old AirPods and tried using them for a while. But I remember why I stopped using them (they were halfway worn out with far from full volume, bad battery life and unbalanced volume levels), and they don't work that well for running. It almost feels like they fall out when you run and your ears are full of sweat.</p>
<p>After a significant amount of research I went with a pair of Plantronics Backbeat Fit 3200. They are not pretty but they work really well. Here is what I like about them in general and in contrast to the AirPods</p>
<ul>
<li>They are IP rated to handle the kind of water you'd expect while running in the rain</li>
<li>They have a thingy behidn the ear + the rubbery thingies you stick in your ear making them very stable in your ear. Even when running</li>
<li>The case has a proper battery indicator with four small leds</li>
<li>The case has a slot you push them into. This works way better than the &quot;magic&quot; of the AirPods, that started to become unreliable not that long after I started using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I prefer my big headphones for most stuff. But these are great for running, walking outside or when I'm walking around in the house and want to listen to books or podcasts while doing stuff.</p>
