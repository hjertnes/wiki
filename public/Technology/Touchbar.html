<p>I didn't get it on my old MacBook. I'll most likely continue to use
that on though.
Now that they have done some changes to the layout of if, I don't think
it is much of a problem.
You have a physical button for Esc, and the TouchID area is divided from
the rest. So you have two small buttons, and the area between them is a
screen.
As far as I can see, there are two problems with how Apple does this:</p>
<ul>
<li>They should sell a external version of it</li>
<li>It should be optional.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways. I quite like it. I installed BetterTouchTool and have
configured it to show an emoji picker, battery status and the currently
playing song. Other than that I like how accessible actions I do a lot
like media controls, volume control, locking screen and mission control.
I think this is something that could get a lot better if Apple put more
love into it.</p>
