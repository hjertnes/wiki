<p>When I first got this MacBook I didn't do anything with the TouchBar, then I looked into customizing it, and I did.</p>
<p>These days I have gone back to make it behave like the f-keys would on a non touchbar MacBook.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to think about it, I don't think it adds much value to me as it is. But I do like the touch id part of it. And I see the need for having a screen instead of buttons to show short messages to the user.</p>
<p>But in general I don't think it in its currenet form, with the current software aiilities to be very useful. If it was more flexible I think it could have been much more interesting.</p>
