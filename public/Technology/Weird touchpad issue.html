<p>I had this really strange issue a few weeks ago. The pointer was lagging
on my work Mac. And after trying to restart more or less everything
else. Including to quit more or less everything on my Mac it turned out
that it was the Trackpad itself.
Really weird. But it kind of makes sense. I think it have been on since
I got it in 2016.</p>
