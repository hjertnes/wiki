<p>I spend a lot of time in areas with far from good cell reception on my daily commute. When you spend 10 hours a week on a train on your commute, you see how bad it is.</p>
<p>This is how cell radios works, when you have a bad signals they keep turning up amplificaitons as far as they can (or most likely are allowed to). This increases battery usage, because they use a lot more power to try to get a good signal.</p>
<p>In general I think this is a good thing. But I miss more smarts on it.</p>
<p>If someone is at the same places a lot, it should be possible to know where it is a point to try to get a signal. It had to be re-evaluated now and them. But I don't see why it have to be like it is today. Another thing the smart phones could do is to integrate with carrier coverage maps.</p>
