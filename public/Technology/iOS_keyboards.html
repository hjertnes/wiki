<p>Ever since Apple added the predictive keyboards to iOS all the new
features have been limited to them. Like for example te 1Password
integration or the swipe typing stuff.</p>
<p>All of that is great, but there are currently two &quot;classes&quot; of
language support in iOS, those who have support for predictive typing
and those who don't have.</p>
<p>After all of this time I think it is 100% bullshit. I think stuff like
this is fine for up to three years. After that Apple should be ashamed
of themselves.</p>
