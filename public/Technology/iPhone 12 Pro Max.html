<p>I can never remember if it is Max Pro or Pro Max. Didn't google it, so
I may be using the wrong title here.</p>
<p>I had to give up my Yellow iPhone 11 when I left Sbanken, and asked for
a blue iPhone 12 Pro Max when I joined Knowit. And I got it like two
weeks ago. Don't remember exactly.</p>
<p>This iPhone is really great. The size is awesome, and they have moved
the buttons around since the iPhone 8 Plus, so it is a lot easier to
use. And it has a larger screen without it feeling larger in the hand.</p>
<p>The phone itself is really fast, and the battery is freaking awesome.
And the camera is really good. I don't use it a lot, but this lens
setup is very solid.</p>
